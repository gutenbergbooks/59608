<p><span class="smcap">In</span> approaching Jacksonville by rail, the
traveler rides hour after hour through seemingly
endless pine barrens, otherwise known
as low pine-woods and flat-woods, till he
wearies of the sight. It would be hard, he
thinks, to imagine a region more unwholesome
looking and uninteresting, more poverty-stricken
and God-forsaken, in its entire
aspect. Surely, men who would risk life in
behalf of such a country deserved to win
their cause.</p>

<p>Monotonous as the flat-woods were, however,
and malarious as they looked,&mdash;arid
wastes and stretches of stagnant water flying
past the car window in perpetual alternation,&mdash;I
was impatient to get into them. They
were a world the like of which I had
never seen; and wherever I went in eastern
Florida, I made it one of my earliest concerns
to seek them out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span></p>

<p>My first impression was one of disappointment,
or perhaps I should rather say, of
bewilderment. In fact, I returned from my
first visit to the flat-woods under the delusion
that I had not been into them at all. This
was at St. Augustine, whither I had gone
after a night only in Jacksonville. I looked
about the quaint little city, of course, and
went to the South Beach, on St. Anastasia
Island; then I wished to see the pine lands.
They were to be found, I was told, on the
other side of the San Sebastian. The sun
was hot (or so it seemed to a man fresh
from the rigors of a New England winter),
and the sand was deep; but I sauntered
through New Augustine, and pushed on up
the road toward Moultrie (I believe it was),
till the last houses were passed and I came
to the edge of the pine-woods. Here, presently,
the roads began to fork in a very
confusing manner. The first man I met&mdash;a
kindly cracker&mdash;cautioned me against
getting lost; but I had no thought of taking
the slightest risk of that kind. I was not
going to <i>explore</i> the woods, but only to enter
them, sit down, look about me, and listen.
The difficulty was to get into them. As I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
advanced, they receded. It was still only
the beginning of a wood; the trees far apart
and comparatively small, the ground covered
thickly with saw-palmetto, interspersed here
and there with patches of brown grass or
sedge.</p>

<p>In many places the roads were under
water, and as I seemed to be making little
progress, I pretty soon sat down in a pleasantly
shaded spot. Wagons came along at
intervals, all going toward the city, most of
them with loads of wood; ridiculously small
loads, such as a Yankee boy would put upon
a wheelbarrow. &ldquo;A fine day,&rdquo; said I to the
driver of such a cart. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a <i>pretty</i> day.&rdquo; He spoke with
an emphasis which seemed to imply that he
accepted my remark as well meant, but
hardly adequate to the occasion. Perhaps,
if the day had been a few shades brighter,
he would have called it &ldquo;handsome,&rdquo; or even
&ldquo;good looking.&rdquo; Expressions of this kind,
however, are matters of local or individual
taste, and as such are not to be disputed
about. Thus, a man stopped me in Tallahassee
to inquire what time it was. I told
him, and he said, "Ah, a little sooner than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
I thought." And why not &ldquo;sooner&rdquo; as
well as "earlier"? But when, on the same
road, two white girls in an ox-cart hailed me
with the question, &ldquo;What time 'tis?&rdquo; I
thought the interrogative idiom a little queer;
almost as queer, shall we say, as &ldquo;How do
you do?&rdquo; may have sounded to the first
man who heard it,&mdash;if the reader is able
to imagine such a person.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, let the morning be &ldquo;fine&rdquo; or
&ldquo;pretty,&rdquo; it was all one to the birds. The
woods were vocal with the cackling of robins,
the warble of bluebirds, and the trills of
pine warblers. Flickers were shouting&mdash;or
laughing, if one pleased to hear it so&mdash;with
true flickerish prolixity, and a single downy
woodpecker called sharply again and again.
A mocking-bird near me (there is <i>always</i> a
mocking-bird near you, in Florida) added
his voice for a time, but soon relapsed into
silence. The fact was characteristic; for,
wherever I went, I found it true that the
mocker grew less musical as the place grew
wilder. By instinct he is a public performer,
he demands an audience; and it is only in
cities, like St. Augustine and Tallahassee,
that he is heard at his freest and best. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
loggerhead shrike&mdash;now close at my elbow,
now farther away&mdash;was practicing his extensive
vocabulary with perseverance, if not
with enthusiasm. Like his relative the
&ldquo;great northern,&rdquo; though perhaps in a less
degree, the loggerhead is commonly at an
extreme, either loquacious or dumb; as if he
could not let his moderation be known unto
any man. Sometimes I fancied him possessed
with an insane ambition to match the
mocking-bird in song as well as in personal
appearance. If so, it is not surprising that
he should be subject to fits of discouragement
and silence. Aiming at the sun,
though a good and virtuous exercise, as we
have all heard, is apt to prove dispiriting to
sensible marksmen. Crows (fish crows, in
all probability, but at the time I did not
know it) uttered strange, hoarse, flat-sounding
caws. Every bird of them must have
been born without a palate, it seemed to me.
White-eyed chewinks were at home in the
dense palmetto scrub, whence they announced
themselves unmistakably by sharp whistles.
Now and then one of them mounted a leaf,
and allowed me to see his pale yellow iris.
Except for this mark, recognizable almost as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
far as the bird could be distinguished at all,
he looked exactly like our common New
England towhee. Somewhere behind me
was a king-fisher&rsquo;s rattle, and from a savanna
in the same direction came the songs of
meadow larks; familiar, but with something
unfamiliar about them at the same time,
unless my ears deceived me.</p>

<p>More interesting than any of the birds yet
named, because more strictly characteristic
of the place, as well as more strictly new to
me, were the brown-headed nuthatches. I
was on the watch for them: they were one
of the three novelties which I knew were to
be found in the pine lands, and nowhere else,&mdash;the
other two being the red-cockaded
woodpecker and the pine-wood sparrow; and
being thus on the lookout, I did not expect
to be taken by surprise, if such a paradox
(it is nothing worse) may be allowed to pass.
But when I heard them twittering in the
distance, as I did almost immediately, I had
no suspicion of what they were. The voice
had nothing of that nasal quality, that Yankee
twang, as some people would call it,
which I had always associated with the nuthatch
family. On the contrary, it was decidedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
finchlike,&mdash;so much so that some of
the notes, taken by themselves, would have
been ascribed without hesitation to the goldfinch
or the pine finch, had I heard them in
New England; and even as things were, I
was more than once deceived for the moment.
As for the birds themselves, they were evidently
a cheerful and thrifty race, much
more numerous than the red-cockaded woodpeckers,
and much less easily overlooked
than the pine-wood sparrows. I seldom
entered the flat-woods anywhere without
finding them. They seek their food largely
about the leafy ends of the pine branches,
resembling the Canadian nuthatches in this
respect, so that it is only on rare occasions
that one sees them creeping about the trunks
or larger limbs. Unlike their two Northern
relatives, they are eminently social, often
traveling in small flocks, even in the breeding
season, and keeping up an almost incessant
chorus of shrill twitters as they flit
hither and thither through the woods. The
first one to come near me was full of inquisitiveness;
he flew back and forth past my head,
exactly as chickadees do in a similar mood,
and once seemed almost ready to alight on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
my hat. &ldquo;Let us have a look at this
stranger,&rdquo; he appeared to be saying. Possibly
his nest was not far off, but I made no
search for it. Afterwards I found two nests,
one in a low stump, and one in the trunk of
a pine, fifteen or twenty feet from the ground.
Both of them contained young ones (March
31 and April 2), as I knew by the continual
goings-in-and-out of the fathers and mothers.
In dress the brown-head is dingy, with little
or nothing of the neat and attractive appearance
of our New England nuthatches.</p>

<p>In this pine-wood on the road to Moultrie
I found no sign of the new woodpecker or
the new sparrow. Nor was I greatly disappointed.
The place itself was a sufficient
novelty,&mdash;the place and the summer weather.
The pines murmured overhead, and the palmettos
rustled all about. Now a butterfly
fluttered past me, and now a dragonfly.
More than one little flock of tree swallows
went over the wood, and once a pair of
ph&#339;bes amused me by an uncommonly pretty
lover&rsquo;s quarrel. Truly it was a pleasant
hour. In the midst of it there came along
a man in a cart, with a load of wood. We
exchanged the time of day, and I remarked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
upon the smallness of his load. Yes, he said;
but it was a pretty heavy load to drag seven
or eight miles over such roads. Possibly he
understood me as implying that he seemed
to be in rather small business, although I had
no such purpose, for he went on to say: &ldquo;In
1861, when this beautiful war broke out between
our countries, my father owned niggers.
We didn&rsquo;t have to do <i>this</i>. But I
don&rsquo;t complain. If I hadn&rsquo;t got a bullet in
me, I should do pretty well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you were in the war?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, sir! I was in the Confederate
service. Yes, sir, I&rsquo;m a Southerner
to the backbone. My grandfather was a
----&rdquo; (I missed the patronymic), &ldquo;and commanded
St. Augustine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name had a foreign sound, and the
man&rsquo;s complexion was swarthy, and in all
simplicity I asked if he was a Minorcan. I
might as well have touched a lighted match
to powder. His eyes flashed, and he came
round the tail of the cart, gesticulating with
his stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Minorcan!&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;Spain and
the island of Minorca are two places, ain&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span></p>

<p>I admitted meekly that they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are English, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;You are English,&mdash;Yankee born,&mdash;ain&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I owned it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m Spanish. That ain&rsquo;t Minorcan.
My grandfather was a &mdash;&mdash;, and commanded
St. Augustine. He couldn&rsquo;t have
done that if he had been Minorcan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time he was quieting down a bit.
His father remembered the Indian war.
The son had heard him tell about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those were dangerous times,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have been standing
out here in the woods then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no danger here now, is there?&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, not now.&rdquo; But as he drove
along he turned to say that <i>he</i> wasn&rsquo;t afraid
of <i>any</i> thing; he wasn&rsquo;t that kind of a man.
Then, with a final turn, he added, what I
could not dispute, &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s life is always
in danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After he was gone, I regretted that I had
offered no apology for my unintentionally
offensive question; but I was so taken by
surprise, and so much interested in the man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
as a specimen, that I quite forgot my manners
till it was too late. One thing I learned:
that it is not prudent, in these days, to judge
a Southern man&rsquo;s blood, in either sense of
the word, by his dress or occupation. This
man had brought seven or eight miles a load
of wood that might possibly be worth seventy-five
cents (I questioned the owner of
what looked like just such a load afterward,
and found his asking price half a dollar), and
for clothing had on a pair of trousers and a
blue cotton shirt, the latter full of holes,
through which the skin was visible; yet his
father was a &mdash;&mdash; and had &ldquo;owned niggers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A still more picturesque figure in this procession
of wood-carters was a boy of perhaps
ten or eleven. He rode his horse, and was
barefooted and barelegged; but he had a
cigarette in his mouth, and to each brown
heel was fastened an enormous spur. Who
was it that infected the world with the foolish
and disastrous notion that work and play
are two different things? And was it Emerson,
or some other wise man, who said that
a boy was the true philosopher?</p>

<p>When it came time to think of returning
to St. Augustine for dinner, I appreciated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
my cracker&rsquo;s friendly warning against losing
my way; for though I had hardly so much
as entered the woods, and had taken, as I
thought, good heed to my steps, I was almost
at once in a quandary as to my road. There
was no occasion for worry,&mdash;with the sun
out, and my general course perfectly plain;
but here was a fork in the road, and whether
to bear to the left or to the right was a simple
matter of guess-work. I made the best
guess I could, and guessed wrong, as was
apparent after a while, when I found the
road under deep water for several rods. I
objected to wading, and there was no ready
way of going round, since the oak and palmetto
scrub crowded close up to the roadside,
and just here was all but impenetrable.
What was still more conclusive, the road
was the wrong one, as the inundation proved,
and, for aught I could tell, might carry me
far out of my course. I turned back, therefore,
under the midday sun, and by good
luck a second attempt brought me out of the
woods very near where I had entered them.
I visited this particular piece of country
but once afterward, having in the mean
time discovered a better place of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
sort along the railroad, in the direction of
Palatka. There, on a Sunday morning, I
heard my first pine-wood sparrow. Time
and tune could hardly have been in truer
accord. The hour was of the quietest, the
strain was of the simplest, and the bird sang
as if he were dreaming. For a long time I
let him go on without attempting to make
certain who he was. He seemed to be rather
far off: if I waited his pleasure, he would
perhaps move toward me; if I disturbed him,
he would probably become silent. So I sat
on the end of a sleeper and listened. It was
not great music. It made me think of the
swamp sparrow; and the swamp sparrow is
far from being a great singer. A single prolonged,
drawling note (in that respect unlike
the swamp sparrow, of course), followed
by a succession of softer and sweeter ones,&mdash;that
was all, when I came to analyze it; but
that is no fair description of what I heard.
The quality of the song is not there; and it
was the quality, the feeling, the soul of it,
if I may say what I mean, that made it, in
the true sense of a much-abused word,
charming.</p>

<p>There could be little doubt that the bird was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
a pine-wood sparrow; but such things are not
to be taken for granted. Once or twice, indeed,
the thought of some unfamiliar warbler
had crossed my mind. At last, therefore, as
the singer still kept out of sight, I leaped the
ditch and pushed into the scrub. Happily I
had not far to go; he had been much nearer
than I thought. A small bird flew up before
me, and dropped almost immediately into a
clump of palmetto. I edged toward the spot
and waited. Then the song began again,
this time directly in front of me, but still faraway-sounding
and dreamy. I find that last
word in my hasty note penciled at the time,
and can think of no other that expresses the
effect half so well. I looked and looked, and
all at once there sat the bird on a palmetto
leaf. Once again he sang, putting up his
head. Then he dropped out of sight, and I
heard nothing more. I had seen only his
head and neck,&mdash;enough to show him a sparrow,
and almost of necessity the pine-wood
sparrow. No other strange member of the
finch family was to be looked for in such a
place.</p>

<p>On further acquaintance, let me say at
once, <i>Pucæa æstivalis</i> proved to be a more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
versatile singer than the performances of my
first bird would have led me to suppose.
He varies his tune freely, but always within
a pretty narrow compass; as is true, also, of
the field sparrow, with whom, as I soon came
to feel, he has not a little in common. It is
in musical form only that he suggests the
swamp sparrow. In tone and spirit, in the
qualities of sweetness and expressiveness,
he is nearly akin to <i>Spizella pusilla</i>. One
does for the Southern pine barren what the
other does for the Northern berry pasture.
And this is high praise; for though in New
England we have many singers more brilliant
than the field sparrow, we have none that
are sweeter, and few that in the long run
give more pleasure to sensitive hearers.</p>

<p>I found the pine-wood sparrow afterward
in New Smyrna, Port Orange, Sanford, and
Tallahassee. So far as I could tell, it was
always the same bird; but I shot no specimens,
and speak with no authority.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
always in the pine lands, and haunting the
dense undergrowth, it is heard a hundred
times where it is seen once,&mdash;a point greatly
in favor of its effectiveness as a musician.
Mr. Brewster speaks of it as singing always
from an elevated perch, while the birds that
I saw in the act of song, a very limited number,
were invariably perched low. One that
I watched in New Smyrna (one of a small
chorus, the others being invisible) sang for
a quarter of an hour from a stake or stump
which rose perhaps a foot above the dwarf
palmetto. It was the same song that I had
heard in St. Augustine; only the birds here
were in a livelier mood, and sang <i>out</i> instead
of <i>sotto voce</i>. The long introductory note
sounded sometimes as if it were indrawn, and
often, if not always, had a considerable burr
in it. Once in a while the strain was caught
up at the end and sung over again, after the
manner of the field sparrow,&mdash;one of that
bird&rsquo;s prettiest tricks. At other times the
song was delivered with full voice, and then
repeated almost under the singer&rsquo;s breath.
This was done beautifully in the Port Orange
flat-woods, the bird being almost at my feet.
I had seen him a moment before, and saw him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
again half a minute later, but at that instant
he was out of sight in the scrub, and
seemingly on the ground. This feature of
the song, one of its chief merits and its most
striking peculiarity, is well described by Mr.
Brewster. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;it has a full,
bell-like ring that seems to fill the air around;
next it is soft and low and inexpressibly tender;
now it is clear again, but so modulated
that the sound seems to come from a great
distance.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

common and typical Florida bird.</p></div>

<p>Not many other birds, I think (I cannot
recall any), habitually vary their song in this
manner. Other birds sing almost inaudibly
at times, especially in the autumnal season.
Even the brown thrasher, whose ordinary
performance is so full-voiced, not to say boisterous,
will sometimes soliloquize, or seem to
soliloquize, in the faintest of undertones.
The formless autumnal warble of the song
sparrow is familiar to every one. And in
this connection I remember, and am not
likely ever to forget, a winter wren who
favored me with what I thought the most
bewitching bit of vocalism to which I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
ever listened. He was in the bushes close
at my side, in the Franconia Notch, and delivered
his whole song, with all its customary
length, intricacy, and speed, in a tone&mdash;a
whisper, I may almost say&mdash;that ran along
the very edge of silence. The unexpected
proximity of a stranger may have had something
to do with his conduct, as it often
appears to have with the thrasher&rsquo;s; but,
however that may be, the cases are not
parallel with that of the pine-wood sparrow,
inasmuch as the latter bird not merely sings
under his breath on special occasions, whether
on account of the nearness of a listener or
for any other reason, but in his ordinary singing
uses louder and softer tones interchangeably,
almost exactly as human singers and
players do; as if, in the practice of his art,
he had learned to appreciate, consciously or
unconsciously (and practice naturally goes
before theory), the expressive value of what
I believe is called musical dynamics.</p>

<p>I spent many half-days in the pine lands
(how gladly now would I spend another!),
but never got far into them. (&ldquo;Into their
depths,&rdquo; my pen was on the point of making
me say; but that would have been a false
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
note. The flat-woods have no &ldquo;depths.&rdquo;)
Whether I followed the railway,&mdash;in many
respects pretty satisfactory method,&mdash;or
some roundabout, aimless carriage road, a
mile or two was generally enough. The
country offers no temptation to pedestrian
feats, nor does the imagination find its account
in going farther and farther. For the
reader is not to think of the flat-woods as in
the least resembling a Northern forest, which
at every turn opens before the visitor and
beckons him forward. Beyond and behind,
and on either side, the pine-woods are ever
the same. It is this monotony, by the bye,
this utter absence of landmarks, that makes
it so unsafe for the stranger to wander far
from the beaten track. The sand is deep,
the sun is hot; one place is as good as another.
What use, then, to tire yourself?
And so, unless the traveler is going somewhere,
as I seldom was, he is continually
stopping by the way. Now a shady spot
entices him to put down his umbrella,&mdash;for
there is a shady spot, here and there, even
in a Florida pine-wood; or blossoms are to
be plucked; or a butterfly, some gorgeous
and nameless creature, brightens the wood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
as it passes; or a bird is singing; or an
eagle is soaring far overhead, and must be
watched out of sight; or a buzzard, with
upturned wings, floats suspiciously near the
wanderer, as if with sinister intent (buzzard
shadows are a regular feature of the flat-wood
landscape, just as cloud shadows are
in a mountainous country); or a snake lies
stretched out in the sun,&mdash;a &ldquo;whip snake,&rdquo;
perhaps, that frightens the unwary stroller
by the amazing swiftness with which it runs
away from him; or some strange invisible
insect is making uncanny noises in the
underbrush. One of my recollections of
the railway woods at St. Augustine is of
a cricket, or locust, or something else,&mdash;I
never saw it,&mdash;that amused me often with
a formless rattling or drumming sound. I
could think of nothing but a boy&rsquo;s first lesson
upon the bones, the rhythm of the beats
was so comically mistimed and bungled.</p>

<p>One fine morning,&mdash;it was the 18th of
February,&mdash;I had gone down the railroad
a little farther than usual, attracted by the
encouraging appearance of a swampy patch
of rather large deciduous trees. Some of
them, I remember, were red maples, already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
full of handsome, high-colored fruit. As I
drew near, I heard indistinctly from among
them what might have been the song of a
black-throated green warbler, a bird that
would have made a valued addition to my
Florida list, especially at that early date.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
No sooner was the song repeated, however,
than I saw that I had beep, deceived; it was
something I had never heard before. But
it certainly had much of the black-throated
green&rsquo;s quality, and without question was
the note of a warbler of some kind. What
a shame if the bird should give me the slip!
Meanwhile, it kept on singing at brief intervals,
and was not so far away but that, with
my glass, I should be well able to make it
out, if only I could once get my eyes on it.
That was the difficulty. Something stirred
among the branches. Yes, a yellow-throated
warbler (<i>Dendroica dominica</i>) a bird of
which I had seen my first specimens, all
of them silent, during the last eight days.
Probably he was the singer. I hoped so, at
any rate. That would be an ideal case of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
beautiful bird with a song to match. I kept
him under my glass, and presently the strain
was repeated, but not by him. Then it
ceased, and I was none the wiser. Perhaps
I never should be. It was indeed a shame.
Such a <i>taking</i> song; so simple, and yet so
pretty, and so thoroughly distinctive. I
wrote it down thus: <i>tee-koi</i>, <i>tee-koo</i>,&mdash;two
couplets, the first syllable of each a little
emphasized and dwelt upon, not drawled,
and a little higher in pitch than its fellow.
Perhaps it might be expressed thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 218px;">
<img src="images/bird_song.png" width="218" height="68" alt="Musical notes" /><br />
</div>

<p class="p0">I cannot profess to be sure of that, however,
nor have I unqualified confidence in the
adequacy of musical notation, no matter
how skillfully employed, to convey a truthful
idea of any bird song.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> As it was, I did not find <i>Dendroica virens</i> in Florida.
On my way home, in Atlanta, April 20, 1 saw one bird in
a dooryard shade-tree.</p></div>

<p>The affair remained a mystery till, in
Daytona, nine days afterward, the same
notes were heard again, this time in lower
trees that did not stand in deep water. Then
it transpired that my mysterious warbler was
not a warbler at all, but the Carolina chickadee.
That was an outcome quite unexpected,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
although I now remembered that chickadees
were in or near the St. Augustine swamp;
and what was more to the purpose, I could
now discern some relationship between the
<i>tee-koi</i>, <i>tee-koo</i> (or, as I now wrote it, <i>see-toi</i>,
<i>see-too</i>), and the familiar so-called ph&#339;be
whistle of the black-capped titmouse. The
Southern bird, I am bound to acknowledge,
is much the more accomplished singer of the
two. Sometimes he repeats the second dissyllable,
making six notes in all. At other
times he breaks out with a characteristic
volley of fine chickadee notes, and runs without
a break into the <i>see-toi</i>, <i>see-too</i>, with a
highly pleasing effect. Then if, on the top
of this, he doubles the <i>see-too</i>, we have a really
prolonged and elaborate musical effort, quite
putting into the shade our New England
bird&rsquo;s <i>hear</i>, <i>hear me</i>, sweet and welcome as
that always is.</p>

<p>The Southern chickadee, it should be said,
is not to be distinguished from its Northern
relative&mdash;in the bush, I mean&mdash;except by
its notes. It is slightly smaller, like Southern
birds in general, but is practically identical
in plumage. Apart from its song, what
most impressed me was its scarcity. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
found, sooner or later, wherever I went, I believe,
but always in surprisingly small numbers,
and I saw only one nest. That was
built in a roadside china-tree in Tallahassee,
and contained young ones (April 17), as was
clear from the conduct of its owners.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that I left St.
Augustine without another search for my
unknown &ldquo;warbler.&rdquo; The very next morning
found me again at the swamp, where for
at least an hour I sat and listened. I heard
no <i>tee-koi</i>, <i>tee-koo</i>, but was rewarded twice
over for my walk. In the first place, before
reaching the swamp, I found the third of my
flat-wood novelties, the red-cockaded woodpecker.
As had happened with the nuthatch
and the sparrow, I heard him before seeing
him: first some notes, which by themselves
would hardly have suggested a woodpecker
origin, and then a noise of hammering.
Taken together, the two sounds left little
doubt as to their author; and presently I
saw him,&mdash;or rather them, for there were
two birds. I learned nothing about them,
either then or afterwards (I saw perhaps
eight individuals during my ten weeks'
visit), but it was worth something barely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span>
see and hear them. Henceforth <i>Dryobates
borealis</i> is a bird, and not merely a name.
This, as I have said, was among the
pines, before reaching the swamp. In the
swamp itself, there suddenly appeared from
somewhere, as if by magic (a dramatic entrance
is not without its value, even out-of-doors),
a less novel but far more impressive
figure, a pileated woodpecker; a truly splendid
fellow, with the scarlet cheek-patches.
When I caught sight of him, he stood on one
of the upper branches of a tall pine, looking
wonderfully alert and wide-awake; now
stretching out his scrawny neck, and now
drawing it in again, his long crest all the
while erect and flaming. After a little he
dropped into the underbrush, out of which
came at intervals a succession of raps. I
would have given something to have had
him under my glass just then, for I had long
felt curious to see him in the act of chiseling
out those big, oblong, clean-cut, sharp-angled
&ldquo;peck-holes&rdquo; which, close to the base of the
tree, make so common and notable a feature
of Vermont and New Hampshire forests; but,
though I did my best, I could not find him,
till all at once he came up again and took to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
a tall pine,&mdash;the tallest in the wood,&mdash;where
he pranced about for a while, striking sundry
picturesque but seemingly aimless attitudes,
and then made off for good. All in all, he
was a wild-looking bird, if ever I saw one.</p>

<p>I was no sooner in St. Augustine, of course,
than my eyes were open for wild flowers.
Perhaps I felt a little disappointed. Certainly
the land was not ablaze with color.
In the grass about the old fort there was
plenty of the yellow oxalis and the creeping
white houstonia; and from a crevice in the
wall, out of reach, leaned a stalk of goldenrod
in full bloom. The reader may smile,
if he will, but this last flower was a surprise
and a stumbling-block. A vernal goldenrod!
Dr. Chapman&rsquo;s Flora made no mention of
such an anomaly. Sow thistles, too, looked
strangely anachronistic. I had never thought
of them as harbingers of springtime. The
truth did not break upon me till a week
or so afterward. Then, on the way to the
beach at Daytona, where the pleasant peninsula
road traverses a thick forest of short-leaved
pines, every tree of which leans heavily
inland at the same angle (&ldquo;the leaning
pines of Daytona,&rdquo; I always said to myself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
as I passed), I came upon some white beggar&rsquo;s-ticks,&mdash;like
daisies; and as I stopped
to see what they were, I noticed the presence
of ripe seeds. The plant had been in flower
a long time. And then I laughed at my own
dullness. It fairly deserved a medal. As
if, even in Massachusetts, autumnal flowers&mdash;the
groundsel, at least&mdash;did not sometimes
persist in blossoming far into the winter!
A day or two after this, I saw a mullein
stalk still presenting arms, as it were (the
mullein always looks the soldier to me), with
one bright flower. If I had found <i>that</i> in
St. Augustine, I flatter myself I should have
been less easily fooled.</p>

<p>There were no such last-year relics in the
flat-woods, so far as I remember, but spring
blossoms were beginning to make their
appearance there by the middle of February,
particularly along the railroad,&mdash;violets in
abundance (<i>Viola cucullata</i>), dwarf orange-colored
dandelions (<i>Krigia</i>), the Judas-tree,
or redbud, St. Peter&rsquo;s-wort, blackberry,
the yellow star-flower (<i>Hypoxis juncea</i>), and
butterworts. I recall, too, in a swampy spot,
a fine fresh tuft of the golden club, with its
gorgeous yellow spadix,&mdash;a plant that I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
never seen in bloom before, although I had
once admired a Cape Cod &ldquo;hollow&rdquo; full of
the rank tropical leaves. St. Peter&rsquo;s-wort,
a low shrub, thrives everywhere in the pine
barrens, and, without being especially attractive,
its rather sparse yellow flowers&mdash;not
unlike the St. John&rsquo;s-wort&mdash;do something to
enliven the general waste. The butterworts
are beauties, and true children of the spring.
I picked my first ones, which by chance were
of the smaller purple species (<i>Pinguicula
pumila</i>), on my way down from the woods,
on a moist bank. At that moment a white
man came up the road. &ldquo;What do you call
this flower?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Valentine&rsquo;s flower,&rdquo;
he answered at once. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;because
it is in bloom on St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day,
I suppose?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you
speak Spanish?&rdquo; I had to shake my head.
&ldquo;Because I could explain it better in Spanish,&rdquo;
he continued, as if by way of apology;
but he went on in perfectly good English:
&ldquo;If you put one of them under your pillow,
and think of some one you would like very
much to see,&mdash;some one who has been dead
a long time,&mdash;you will be likely to dream of
him. It is a very pretty flower,&rdquo; he added.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span>
And so it is; hardly prettier, however, to my
thinking, than the blossoms of the early
creeping blackberry (<i>Rubus trivialis</i>). With
them I fairly fell in love: true white roses,
I called them, each with its central ring of
dark purplish stamens; as beautiful as the
cloudberry, which once, ten years before, I
had found on the summit of Mount Clinton,
in New Hampshire, and refused to believe
a <i>Rubus</i>, though Dr. Gray&rsquo;s key led me to
that genus again and again. There <i>is</i> something
in a name, say what you will.</p>

<p>Some weeks later, and a little farther
south,&mdash;in the flat-woods behind New
Smyrna,&mdash;I saw other flowers, but never
anything of that tropical exuberance at which
the average Northern tourist expects to find
himself staring. Boggy places were full of
blue iris (the common <i>Iris versicolor</i> of New
England, but of ranker growth), and here
and there a pool was yellow with bladderwort.
I was taken also with the larger
and taller (yellow) butterwort, which I
used never to see as I went through the
woods in the morning, but was sure to find
standing in the tall dry grass along the
border of the sandy road, here one and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
there one, on my return at noon. In similar
places grew a &ldquo;yellow daisy&rdquo; (<i>Leptopoda</i>),
a single big head, of a deep color,
at the top of a leafless stem. It seemed to
be one of the most abundant of Florida
spring flowers, but I could not learn that it
went by any distinctive vernacular name.
Beside the railway track were blue-eyed
grass and pipewort, and a dainty blue lobelia
(<i>L. Feayana</i>), with once in a while an extremely
pretty coreopsis, having a purple
centre, and scarcely to be distinguished from
one that is common in gardens. No doubt
the advancing season brings an increasing
wealth of such beauty to the flat-woods.
No doubt, too, I missed the larger half of
what might have been found even at the
time of my visit; for I made no pretense
of doing any real botanical work, having
neither the time nor the equipment. The
birds kept me busy, for the most part, when
the country itself did not absorb my attention.</p>

<p>More interesting, and a thousand times
more memorable, than any flower or bird
was the pine barren itself. I have given no
true idea of it, I am perfectly aware: open,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
parklike, flooded with sunshine, level as a
floor. &ldquo;What heartache,&rdquo; Lanier breaks
out, poor exile, dying of consumption,&mdash;&ldquo;what
heartache! Ne&rsquo;er a hill!&rdquo; A dreary
country to ride through, hour after hour; an
impossible country to live in, but most
pleasant for a half-day winter stroll. Notwithstanding
I never went far into it, as I
have already said, I had always a profound
sensation of remoteness; as if I might go
on forever, and be no farther away.</p>

<p>Yet even here I had more than one reminder
that the world is a small place. I
met a burly negro in a cart, and fell into
talk with him about the Florida climate, an
endless topic, out of which a cynical traveler
may easily extract almost endless amusement.
How about the summers here? I
inquired. Were they really as paradisaical
(I did not use that word) as some reports
would lead one to suppose? The man smiled,
as if he had heard something like that before.
He did not think the Florida summer a dream
of delight, even on the east coast. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
tellin' you the truth, sah; the mosquiters an'
sand-flies is awful.&rdquo; Was he born here? I
No; he came from B&mdash;&mdash;, Alabama.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
Everybody in eastern Florida came
from somewhere, as well as I could make out.
&ldquo;Oil, from B&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Did you know
Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, of the &mdash;&mdash; Iron Works?&rdquo;
He smiled again. &ldquo;Yes, sah; I used to
work for him. He&rsquo;s a nice man.&rdquo; He spoke
the truth that time beyond a peradventure.
He was healthier here than in the other
place, he thought, and wages were higher;
but he liked the other place better &ldquo;for
pleasure.&rdquo; It was an odd coincidence, was
it not, that I should meet in this solitude a
man who knew the only citizen of Alabama
with whom I was ever acquainted.</p>

<p>At another time I fell in with an oldish
colored man, who, like myself, had taken to
the woods for a quiet Sunday stroll. <i>He</i> was
from Mississippi, he told me. Oh, yes, he
remembered the war; he was a slave, twenty-one
years old, when it broke out. To his
mind, the present generation of &ldquo;niggers&rdquo;
were a pretty poor lot, for all their &ldquo;edication.&rdquo;
He had seen them crowding folks off
the sidewalk, and puffing smoke in their
faces. All of which was nothing new; I had
found that story more or less common among
negroes of his age. He didn&rsquo;t believe much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
in &ldquo;edication;&rdquo; but when I asked if he
thought the blacks were better off in slavery
times, he answered quickly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be
a free man, <i>I</i> had.&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t married;
he had plenty to do to take care of himself.
We separated, he going one way and I the
other; but he turned to ask, with much
seriousness (the reader must remember that
this was only three months after a national
election), &ldquo;Do you think they&rsquo;ll get free
trade?&rdquo; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said I to myself, &ldquo;&lsquo;the
world is too much with us.&rsquo; Even in the
flat-woods there is no escaping the tariff question.&rdquo;
But I answered, in what was meant
to be a reassuring tone, &ldquo;Not yet awhile.
Some time.&rdquo; &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;as if
liberty to buy and sell would be a dreadful
blow to a man living in a shanty in a Florida
pine barren! He was taking the matter
rather too much to heart, perhaps; but
surely it was encouraging to see such a man
interested in broad economical questions, and
I realized as never before the truth of what
the newspapers so continually tell us, that
political campaigns are educational.</p>

of sails behind the trees. Eastward are
sand-hills, dazzling white in the sun, with a
ragged green fringe along their tops. Then
comes a stretch of the open sea, and then,
more to the south, St. Anastasia Island, with
its tall black-and-white lighthouse and the
cluster of lower buildings at its base. Small
sailboats, and now and then a tiny steamer,
pass up and down the river to and from St.
Augustine.</p>

<p>A delicious south wind is blowing (it is
the 15th of February), and I sit in the shade
of a cedar-tree and enjoy the air and the
scene. A contrast, this, to the frozen world
I was living in, less than a week ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span></p>

<p>As I approached the creek, a single spotted
sandpiper was teetering along the edge of
the water, and the next moment a big blue
heron rose just beyond him and went flapping
away to the middle of the marsh. Now,
an hour afterward, he is still standing there,
towering above the tall grass. Once when I
turned that way I saw, as I thought, a stake,
and then something moved upon it,&mdash;a bird
of some kind. And what an enormous beak!
I raised my field-glass. It was the heron.
His body was the post, and his head was the
bird. Meanwhile, the sandpiper has stolen
away, I know not when or where. He must
have omitted the <i>tweet</i>, <i>tweet</i>, with which
ordinarily he signalizes his flight. He is the
first of his kind that I have seen during my
brief stay in these parts.</p>

<p>Now a multitude of crows pass over; fish
crows, I think they must be, from their small
size and their strange, ridiculous voices. And
now a second great blue heron comes in sight,
and keeps on over the marsh and over the
live-oak wood, on his way to the San Sebastian
marshes, or some point still more remote.
A fine show he makes, with his wide expanse
of wing, and his feet drawn up and standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
out behind him. Next a marsh hawk in
brown plumage comes skimming over the
grass. This way and that he swerves in ever
graceful lines. For one to whom ease and
grace come by nature, even the chase of
meadow mice is an act of beauty, while another
goes awkwardly though in pursuit of a
goddess.</p>

<p>Several times I have noticed a kingfisher
hovering above the grass (so it looks, but no
doubt he is over an arm of the creek), striking
the air with quick strokes, and keeping
his head pointed downward, after the manner
of a tern. Then he disappeared while I was
looking at something else. Now I remark
him sitting motionless upon the top of a post
in the midst of the marsh.</p>

<p>A third blue heron appears, and he too
flies over without stopping. Number One
still keeps his place; through the glass I can
see him dressing his feathers with his clumsy
beak. The lively strain of a white-eyed vireo,
pertest of songsters, comes to me from somewhere
on my right, and the soft chipping of
myrtle warblers is all but incessant. I look
up from my paper to see a turkey buzzard
sailing majestically northward. I watch him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
till he fades in the distance. Not once does
he flap his wings, but sails and sails, going
with the wind, yet turning again and again
to rise against it,&mdash;helping himself thus to
its adverse, uplifting pressure in the place of
wing-strokes, perhaps,&mdash;and passing onward
all the while in beautiful circles. He, too,
scavenger though he is, has a genius for being
graceful. One might almost be willing
to be a buzzard, to fly like that!</p>

<p>The kingfisher and the heron are still at
their posts. An exquisite yellow butterfly,
of a sort strange to my Yankee eyes, flits
past, followed by a red admiral. The marsh
hawk is on the wing again, and while looking
at him I descry a second hawk, too far
away to be made out. Now the air behind
me is dark with crows,&mdash;a hundred or two,
at least, circling over the low cedars. Some
motive they have for all their clamor, but it
passes my owlish wisdom to guess what it
can be. A fourth blue heron appears, and
drops into the grass out of sight.</p>

<p>Between my feet is a single blossom of the
yellow oxalis, the only flower to be seen; and
very pretty it is, each petal with an orange
spot at the base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span></p>

<p>Another buzzard, another marsh hawk,
another yellow butterfly, and then a smaller
one, darker, almost orange. It passes too
quickly over the creek and away. The marsh
hawk comes nearer, and I see the strong yellow
tinge of his plumage, especially underneath.
He will grow handsomer as he grows
older. A pity the same could not be true of
men. Behind me are sharp cries of titlarks.
From the direction of the river come frequent
reports of guns. Somebody is doing his best
to be happy! All at once I prick up my ears.
From the grass just across the creek rises the
brief, hurried song of a long-billed marsh
wren. So <i>he</i> is in Florida, is he? Already
I have heard confused noises which I feel
sure are the work of rails of some kind. No
doubt there is abundant life concealed in
those acres on acres of close grass.</p>

<p>The heron and the kingfisher are still quiet.
Their morning hunt was successful, and for
to-day Fate cannot harm them. A buzzard,
with nervous, rustling beats, goes directly
above the low cedar under which I am resting.</p>

<p>At last, after a siesta of two hours, the
heron has changed his place. I looked up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
just in season to see him sweeping over the
grass, into which he dropped the next instant.
The tide is falling. The distant sand-hills
are winking in the heat, but the breeze is
deliciously cool, the very perfection of temperature,
if a man is to sit still in the shade.
It is eleven o&rsquo;clock. I have a mile to go in
the hot sun, and turn away. But first I sweep
the line once more with my glass. Yonder
to the south are two more blue herons standing
in the grass. Perhaps there are more
still. I sweep the line. Yes, far, far away
I can see four heads in a row. Heads and
necks rise above the grass. But so far away!
Are they birds, or only posts made alive by
my imagination? I look again. I believe I
was deceived. They are nothing but stakes.
See how in a row they stand. I smile at myself.
Just then one of them moves, and another
is pulled down suddenly into the grass.
I smile again. &ldquo;Ten great blue herons,&rdquo; I
say to myself.</p>

<p>All this has detained me, and meantime
the kingfisher has taken wing and gone noisily
up the creek. The marsh hawk appears once
more. A killdeer&rsquo;s sharp, rasping note&mdash;a
familiar sound in St. Augustine&mdash;comes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span>
from I know not where. A procession of
more than twenty black vultures passes over
my head. I can see their feet drawn up
under them. My own I must use in plodding
homeward.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="ON_THE_BEACH_AT_DAYTONA" id="ON_THE_BEACH_AT_DAYTONA">ON THE BEACH AT DAYTONA.</a></p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first eight days of my stay in Daytona
were so delightful that I felt as if I
had never before seen fine weather, even in
my dreams. My east window looked across
the Halifax River to the peninsula woods.
Beyond them was the ocean. Immediately
after breakfast, therefore, I made toward the
north bridge, and in half an hour or less was
on the beach. Beaches are much the same
the world over, and there is no need to describe
this one&mdash;Silver Beach, I think I
heard it called&mdash;except to say that it is
broad, hard, and, for a pleasure-seeker&rsquo;s
purpose, endless. It is backed by low sand-hills
covered with impenetrable scrub,&mdash;oak
and palmetto,&mdash;beyond which is a
dense growth of short-leaved pines. Perfect
weather, a perfect beach, and no throng
of people: here were the conditions of happiness;
and here for eight days I found it.
The ocean itself was a solitude. Day after
day not a sail was in sight. Looking up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span>
and clown the beach, I could usually see
somewhere in the distance a carriage or two,
and as many foot passengers; but I often
walked a mile, or sat for half an hour, without
being within hail of any one. Never
were airs more gentle or colors more exquisite.</p>

<p>As for birds, they were surprisingly
scarce, but never wanting altogether. If
everything else failed, a few fish-hawks
were sure to be in sight. I watched them
at first with eager interest. Up and down
the beach they went, each by himself, with
heads pointed downward, scanning the shallow
water. Often they stopped in their
course, and by means of laborious flappings
held themselves poised over a certain spot.
Then, perhaps, they set their wings and shot
downward clean under water. If the plunge
was unsuccessful, they shook their feathers
dry and were ready to begin again. They
had the fisherman&rsquo;s gift. The second, and
even the third attempt might fail, but no
matter; it was simply a question of time
and patience. If the fish was caught, their
first concern seemed to be to shift their hold
upon it, till its head pointed to the front.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span>
That done, they shook themselves vigorously
and started landward, the shining white victim
wriggling vainly in the clutch of the talons.
I took it for granted that they retired
with their quarry to some secluded spot on
the peninsula, till one day I happened to be
standing upon a sand-hill as one passed
overhead. Then I perceived that he kept
on straight across the peninsula and the
river. More than once, however, I saw one
of them in no haste to go inland. On my
second visit, a hawk came circling about my
head, carrying a fish. I was surprised at
the action, but gave it no second thought,
nor once imagined that he was making me
his protector, till suddenly a large bird
dropped rather awkwardly upon the sand,
not far before me. He stood for an instant
on his long, ungainly legs, and then, showing
a white head and a white tail, rose with a
fish in his talons, and swept away landward
out of sight. Here was the osprey&rsquo;s parasite,
the bald eagle, for which I had been
on the watch. Meantime, the hawk too
had disappeared. Whether it was his fish
which the eagle had picked up (having
missed it in the air) I cannot say. I did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
not see it fall, and knew nothing of the
eagle&rsquo;s presence until he fluttered to the
beach.</p>

<p>Some days later, I saw the big thief&mdash;emblem
of American liberty&mdash;play his
sharp game to the finish. I was crossing
the bridge, and by accident turned and
looked upward. (By accident, I say, but I
was always doing it.) High in the air were
two birds, one chasing the other,&mdash;a fish-hawk
and a young eagle with dark head
and tail. The hawk meant to save his dinner
if he could. Round and round he went,
ascending at every turn, his pursuer after
him hotly. For aught I could see, he stood
a good chance of escape, till all at once
another pair of wings swept into the field
of my glass.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A third is in the race! Who is the third,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speeding away swift as the eagle bird?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It <i>was</i> an eagle, an adult, with head and
tail white. Only once more the osprey circled.
The odds were against him, and he
let go the fish. As it fell, the old eagle
swooped after it, missed it, swooped again,
and this time, long before it could reach
the water, had it fast in his claws. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">« 45 »</a></span>
off he went, the younger one in pursuit.
They passed out of sight behind the trees
of an island, one close upon the other, and
I do not know how the controversy ended;
but I would have wagered a trifle on the
old white-head, the bird of Washington.</p>

<p>The scene reminded me of one I had witnessed
in Georgia a fortnight before, on my
way south. The train stopped at a backwoods
station; some of the passengers gathered
upon the steps of the car, and the
usual bevy of young negroes came alongside.
&ldquo;Stand on my head for a nickel?&rdquo; said
one. A passenger put his hand into his
pocket; the boy did as he had promised,&mdash;in
no very professional style, be it said,&mdash;and
with a grin stretched out his hand.
The nickel glistened in the sun, and on
the instant a second boy sprang forward,
snatched it out of the sand, and made off
in triumph amid the hilarious applause of
his fellows. The acrobat&rsquo;s countenance indicated
a sense of injustice, and I had no
doubt that my younger eagle was similarly
affected. &ldquo;Where is our boasted honor
among thieves?&rdquo; I imagined him asking.
The bird of freedom is a great bird, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span>
land of the free is a great country. Here,
let us hope, the parallel ends. Whether
on the banks of Newfoundland or elsewhere,
it cannot be that the great republic would
ever snatch a fish that did not belong to it.</p>

<p>I admired the address of the fish-hawks
until I saw the gannets. Then I perceived
that the hawks, with all their practice, were
no better than landlubbers. The gannets
kept farther out at sea. Sometimes a scattered
flock remained in sight for the greater
part of a forenoon. With their long, sharp
wings and their outstretched necks,&mdash;like
loons, but with a different flight,&mdash;they
were rakish-looking customers. Sometimes
from a great height, sometimes from a lower,
sometimes at an incline, and sometimes vertically,
they plunged into the water, and
after an absence of some seconds, as it
seemed, came up and rested upon the surface.
They were too far away to be closely
observed, and for a time I did not feel certain
what they were. The larger number
were in dark plumage, and it was not till
a white one appeared that I said with assurance,
&ldquo;Gannets!&rdquo; With the bright
sun on him, he was indeed a splendid bird,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">« 47 »</a></span>
snowy white, with the tips of his wings jet
black. If he would have come inshore like
the ospreys, I think I should never have
tired of his evolutions.</p>

<p>The gannets showed themselves only now
and then, but the brown pelicans were an
every-day sight. I had found them first
on the beach at St. Augustine. Here at
Daytona they never alighted on the sand,
and seldom in the water. They were always
flying up or down the beach, and, unless
turned from their course by the presence of
some suspicious object, they kept straight on
just above the breakers, rising and falling
with the waves; now appearing above them,
and now out of sight in the trough of the
sea. Sometimes a single bird passed, but
commonly they were in small flocks. Once
I saw seventeen together,&mdash;a pretty long
procession; for, whatever their number, they
went always in Indian file. Evidently some
dreadful thing would happen if two pelicans
should ever travel abreast. It was partly
this unusual order of march, I suspect, which
gave such an air of preternatural gravity
to their movements. It was impossible to
see even two of them go by without feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">« 48 »</a></span>
almost as if I were in church. First, both
birds flew a rod or two with slow and stately
flappings; then, as if at some preconcerted
signal, both set their wings and scaled for
about the same distance; then they resumed
their wing-strokes; and so on, till they passed
out of sight. I never heard them utter a
sound, or saw them make a movement of any
sort (I speak of what I saw at Daytona) except
to fly straight on, one behind another.
If church ceremonials are still open to amendment,
I would suggest, in no spirit of irreverence,
that a study of pelican processionals
would be certain to yield edifying results.
Nothing done in any cathedral could be more
solemn. Indeed, their solemnity was so great
that I came at last to find it almost ridiculous;
but that, of course, was only from a want of
faith on the part of the beholder. The birds,
as I say, were <i>brown</i> pelicans. Had they
been of the other species, in churchly white
and black, the ecclesiastical effect would perhaps
have been heightened, though such a
thing is hardly conceivable.</p>

<p>Some beautiful little gulls, peculiarly dainty
in their appearance (&ldquo;Bonaparte&rsquo;s gulls,&rdquo;
they are called in books, but &ldquo;surf gulls&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">« 49 »</a></span>
would be a prettier and apter name), were
also given to flying along the breakers, but
in a manner very different from the pelicans';
as different, I may say, as the birds themselves.
They, too, moved steadily onward,
north or south as the case might be, but fed
as they went, dropping into the shallow water
between the incoming waves, and rising
again to escape the next breaker. The action
was characteristic and graceful, though
often somewhat nervous and hurried. I noticed
that the birds commonly went by twos,
but that may have been nothing more than
a coincidence. Beside these small surf gulls,
never at all numerous, I usually saw a few
terns, and now and then one or two rather
large gulls, which, as well as I could make
out, must have been the ring-billed. It was
a strange beach, I thought, where fish-hawks
invariably outnumbered both gulls and terns.
Of beach birds, properly so called, I saw
none but sanderlings. They were no novelty,
but I always stopped to look at them; busy
as ants, running in a body down the beach
after a receding wave, and the next moment
scampering back again with all speed before
an incoming one. They tolerated no near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
approach, but were at once on the wing for a
long flight up or down the coast, looking like
a flock of snow-white birds as they turned
their under parts to the sun in rising above
the breakers. Their manner of feeding, with
the head pitched forward, and a quick, eager
movement, as if they had eaten nothing for
days, and were fearful that their present bit
of good fortune would not last, is strongly
characteristic, so that they can be recognized
a long way off. As I have said, they were
the only true beach birds; but I rarely failed
to see one or two great blue herons playing
that role. The first one filled me with surprise.
I had never thought of finding him
in such a place; but there he stood, and before
I was done with Florida beaches I had
come to look upon him as one of their most
constant <i>habitués</i>. In truth, this largest
of the herons is well-nigh omnipresent in
Florida. Wherever there is water, fresh or
salt, he is certain to be met with sooner or
later; and even in the driest place, if you
stay there long enough, you will be likely
to see him passing overhead, on his way
to the water, which is nowhere far off. On
the beach, as everywhere else, he is a model
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">« 51 »</a></span>
of patience. To the best of my recollection,
I never saw him catch a fish there; and I
really came to think it pathetic, the persistency
with which he would stand, with the
water half-way to his knees, leaning forward
expectantly toward the breakers, as
if he felt that this great and generous ocean,
which had so many fish to spare, could not
fail to send him, at last, the morsel for which
he was waiting.</p>

<p>But indeed I was not long in perceiving
that the Southern climate made patience a
comparatively easy virtue, and fishing, by a
natural consequence, a favorite avocation.
Day after day, as I crossed the bridges on
my way to and from the beach, the same men
stood against the rail, holding their poles over
the river. They had an air of having been
there all winter. I came to recognize them,
though I knew none of their names. One
was peculiarly happy looking, almost radiant,
with an educated face, and only one hand.
His disability hindered him, no doubt. I
never saw so much as a sheep-head or a drum
lying at his feet. But inwardly, I felt sure,
his luck was good. Another was older, fifty
at least, sleek and well dressed. He spoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">« 52 »</a></span>
pleasantly enough, if I addressed him; otherwise
he attended strictly to business. Every
day he was there, morning and afternoon.
He, I think, had better fortune than any of
the others. Once I saw him land a large
and handsome &ldquo;speckled trout,&rdquo; to the unmistakable
envy of his brother anglers. Still
a third was a younger man, with a broad-brimmed
straw hat and a taciturn habit;
no less persevering than Number Two, perhaps,
but far less successful. I marveled a
little at their enthusiasm (there were many
beside these), and they, in their turn, did
not altogether conceal their amusement at
the foibles of a man, still out of Bedlam, who
walked and walked and walked, always with
a field-glass protruding from his side pocket,
which now and then he pulled out suddenly
and leveled at nothing. It is one of the
merciful ameliorations of this present evil
world that men are thus mutually entertaining.</p>

<p>These anglers were to be congratulated.
Ordered South by their physicians,&mdash;as most
of them undoubtedly were,&mdash;compelled to
spend the winter away from friends and business,
amid all the discomforts of Southern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">« 53 »</a></span>
hotels, they were happy in having at least
one thing which they loved to do. Blessed
is the invalid who has an outdoor hobby.
One man, whom I met more than once in
my beach rambles, seemed to devote himself
to bathing, running, and walking. He looked
like an athlete; I heard him tell how far
he could run without getting &ldquo;winded;&rdquo; and
as he sprinted up and down the sand in his
scanty bathing costume, I always found him
a pleasing spectacle. Another runner there
gave me a half-hour of amusement that turned
at the last to a feeling of almost painful
sympathy. He was not in bathing costume,
nor did he look particularly athletic. He
was teaching his young lady to ride a bicycle,
and his pupil was at that most interesting
stage of a learner&rsquo;s career when the machine
is beginning to steady itself. With a very
little assistance she went bravely, while at the
same time the young man felt it necessary
not to let go his hold upon her for more than
a few moments at once. At all events, he
must be with her at the turn. She plied the
pedals with vigor, and he ran alongside or
behind, as best he could; she excited, and
he out of breath. Back and forth they went,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">« 54 »</a></span>
and it was a relief to me when finally he took
off his coat. I left him still panting in his
fair one&rsquo;s wake, and hoped it would not turn
out a case of &ldquo;love&rsquo;s labor&rsquo;s lost.&rdquo; Let us
hope, too, that he was not an invalid.</p>

<p>While speaking of these my companions
in idleness, I may as well mention an older
man,&mdash;a rural philosopher, he seemed,&mdash;whom
I met again and again, always in search
of shells. He was from Indiana, he told me
with agreeable garrulity. His grandchildren
would like the shells. He had perhaps made
a mistake in coming so far south. It was
pretty warm, he thought, and he feared the
change would be too great when he went
home again. If a man&rsquo;s lungs were bad, he
ought to go to a warm place, of course. <i>He</i>
came for his stomach, which was now pretty
well,&mdash;a capital proof of the superior value
of fresh air over &ldquo;proper&rdquo; food in dyspeptic
troubles; for if there is anywhere in the
world a place in which a delicate stomach
would fare worse than in a Southern hotel,&mdash;of
the second or third class,&mdash;may none
but my enemies ever find it. Seashell collecting
is not a panacea. For a disease like
old age, for instance, it might prove to be an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">« 55 »</a></span>
alleviation rather than a cure; but taken
long enough, and with a sufficient mixture of
enthusiasm,&mdash;a true <i>sine qua non</i>,&mdash;it will
be found efficacious, I believe, in all ordinary
cases of dyspepsia.</p>

<p>My Indiana man was far from being alone
in his cheerful pursuit. If strangers, men or
women, met me on the beach and wished to
say something more than good-morning, they
were sure to ask, &ldquo;Have you found any
pretty shells?&rdquo; One woman was a collector
of a more businesslike turn. She had
brought a camp-stool, and when I first saw
her in the distance was removing her shoes,
and putting on rubber boots. Then she
moved her stool into the surf, sat upon it
with a tin pail beside her, and, leaning forward
over the water, fell to doing something,&mdash;I
could not tell what. She was so industrious
that I did not venture to disturb her,
as I passed; but an hour or two afterward
I overtook her going homeward across the
peninsula with her invalid husband, and she
showed me her pail full of the tiny coquina
clams, which she said were very nice for soup,
as indeed I knew. Some days later, I found
a man collecting them for the market, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">« 56 »</a></span>
the help of a horse and a cylindrical wire
roller. With his trousers rolled to his knees,
he waded in the surf, and shoveled the incoming
water and sand into the wire roller
through an aperture left for that purpose.
Then he closed the aperture, and drove the
horse back and forth through the breakers
till the clams were washed clear of the sand,
after which he poured them out into a shallow
tray like a long bread-pan, and transferred
them from that to a big bag. I came
up just in time to see them in the tray, bright
with all the colors of the rainbow. &ldquo;Will
you hold the bag open?&rdquo; he said. I was
glad to help (it was perhaps the only useful
ten minutes that I passed in Florida); and
so, counting quart by quart, he dished them
into it. There were thirty odd quarts, but
he wanted a bushel and a quarter, and again
took up the shovel. The clams themselves
were not canned and shipped, he said, but
only the &ldquo;juice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many rudely built cottages stood on the
sand-hills just behind the beach, especially
at the points, a mile or so apart, where
the two Daytona bridge roads come out of
the scrub; and one day, while walking up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">« 57 »</a></span>
beach to Ormond, I saw before me a much
more elaborate Queen Anne house. Fancifully
but rather neatly painted, and with a
stable to match, it looked like an exotic. As
I drew near, its venerable owner was at work
in front of it, shoveling a path through the
sand,&mdash;just as, at that moment (February
24), thousands of Yankee householders were
shoveling paths through the snow, which
then was reported by the newspapers to be
seventeen inches deep in the streets of Boston.
His reverend air and his long black coat proclaimed
him a clergyman past all possibility
of doubt. He seemed to have got to heaven
before death, the place was so attractive; but
being still in a body terrestrial, he may have
found the meat market rather distant, and
mosquitoes and sand-flies sometimes a plague.
As I walked up the beach, he drove by me
in an open wagon with a hired man. They
kept on till they came to a log which had
been cast up by the sea, and evidently had
been sighted from the house. The hired man
lifted it into the wagon, and they drove
back,&mdash;quite a stirring adventure, I imagined;
an event to date from, at the very
least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span></p>

<p>The smaller cottages were nearly all empty
at that season. At different times I made
use of many of them, when the sun was hot,
or I had been long afoot. Once I was resting
thus on a flight of front steps, when a
three-seated carriage came down the beach
and pulled up opposite. The driver wished
to ask me a question, I thought; no doubt I
looked very much at home. From the day I
had entered Florida, every one I met had
seemed to know me intuitively for a New
Englander, and most of them&mdash;I could not
imagine how&mdash;had divined that I came from
Boston. It gratified me to believe that I
was losing a little of my provincial manner,
under the influence of more extended travel.
But my pride had a sudden fall. The carriage
stopped, as I said; but instead of inquiring
the way, the driver alighted, and all
the occupants of the carriage proceeded to
do the same,&mdash;eight women, with baskets
and sundries. It was time for me to be starting.
I descended the steps, and pulled off
my hat to the first comer, who turned out to
be the proprietor of the establishment. With
a gracious smile, she hoped they were &ldquo;not
frightening me away.&rdquo; She and her friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">« 59 »</a></span>
had come for a day&rsquo;s picnic at the cottage.
Things being as they were (eight women),
she could hardly invite me to share the festivities,
and, with my best apology for the
intrusion, I withdrew.</p>

<p>Of one building on the sand-hills I have
peculiarly pleasant recollections. It was not
a cottage, but had evidently been put up as
a public resort; especially, as I inferred,
for Sunday-school or parish picnics. It was
furnished with a platform for speech-making
(is there any foolishness that men will not
commit on sea beaches and mountain tops?),
and, what was more to my purpose, was
open on three sides. I passed a good deal
of time there, first and last, and once it
sheltered me from a drenching shower of
an hour or two. The lightning was vivid,
and the rain fell in sheets. In the midst of
the blackness and commotion, a single tern,
ghostly white, flew past, and toward the
close a bunch of sanderlings came down the
edge of the breakers, still looking for something
to eat. The only other living things
in sight were two young fellows, who had
improved the opportunity to try a dip in the
surf. Their color indicated that they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">« 60 »</a></span>
not yet hardened to open-air bathing, and
from their actions it was evident that they
found the ocean cool. They were wet enough
before they were done, but it was mostly
with fresh water. Probably they took no
harm; but I am moved to remark, in passing,
that I sometimes wondered how generally
physicians who order patients to
Florida for the winter caution them against
imprudent exposure. To me, who am no
doctor, it seemed none too safe for young
women with consumptive tendencies to be out
sailing in open boats on winter evenings, no
matter how warm the afternoon had been,
while I saw one case where a surf bath taken
by such an invalid was followed by a day of
prostration and fever. &ldquo;We who live here,&rdquo;
said a resident, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think the water is
warm enough yet; but for these Northern
folks it is a great thing to go into the surf
in February, and you can&rsquo;t keep them out.&rdquo;
The rows of cottages of which I have
spoken were in one sense a detriment to the
beach; but on the whole, and in their present
deserted condition, I found them an
advantage. It was easy enough to walk
away from them, if a man wanted the feeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">« 61 »</a></span>
of utter solitude (the beach extends
from Matanzas Inlet to Mosquito Inlet,
thirty-five miles, more or less); while at
other times they not only furnished shadow
and a seat, but, with the paths and little
clearings behind them, were an attraction
to many birds. Here I found my first
Florida jays. They sat on the chimney-tops
and ridgepoles, and I was rejoiced to
discover that these unique and interesting
creatures, one of the special objects of my
journey South, were not only common, but
to an extraordinary degree approachable.
Their extreme confidence in man is one of
their oddest characteristics. I heard from
more than one person how easily and &ldquo;in
almost no time&rdquo; they could be tamed, if
indeed they needed taming. A resident of
Hawks Park told me that they used to come
into his house and stand upon the corners
of the dinner table waiting for their share
of the meal. When he was hoeing in the
garden, they would perch on his hat, and
stay there by the hour, unless he drove them
off. He never did anything to tame them
except to treat them kindly. When a brood
was old enough to leave the nest, the parents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">« 62 »</a></span>
brought the youngsters up to the doorstep
as a matter of course.</p>

<p>The Florida jay, a bird of the scrub, is
not to be confounded with the Florida <i>blue</i>
jay (a smaller and less conspicuously crested
duplicate of our common Northern bird),
to which it bears little resemblance either
in personal appearance or in voice. Seen
from behind, its aspect is peculiarly striking;
the head, wings, rump, and tail being
dark blue, with an almost rectangular patch
of gray set in the midst. Its beak is very
stout, and its tail very long; and though it
would attract attention anywhere, it is hardly
to be called handsome or graceful. Its
notes&mdash;such of them as I heard, that is&mdash;are
mostly guttural, with little or nothing of
the screaming quality which distinguishes
the blue jay&rsquo;s voice. To my ear they were
often suggestive of the Northern shrike.</p>

<p>On the 23d of February I was standing
on the rear piazza of one of the cottages,
when a jay flew into the oak and palmetto
scrub close by. A second glance, and I saw
that she was busy upon a nest. When she
had gone, I moved nearer, and waited. She
did not return, and I descended the steps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">« 63 »</a></span>
and went to the edge of the thicket to inspect
her work: a bulky affair,&mdash;nearly
done, I thought,&mdash;loosely constructed of
pretty large twigs. I had barely returned
to the veranda before the bird appeared
again. This time I was in a position to
look squarely in upon her. She had some
difficulty in edging her way through the
dense bushes with a long, branching stick
in her bill; but she accomplished the feat,
fitted the new material into its place, readjusted
the other twigs a bit here and
there, and then, as she rose to depart, she
looked me suddenly in the face and stopped,
as much as to say, &ldquo;Well, well! here&rsquo;s a
pretty go! A man spying upon me!&rdquo; I
wondered whether she would throw up the
work, but in another minute she was back
again with another twig. The nest, I should
have said, was about four feet from the
ground, and perhaps twenty feet from the
cottage. Four days later, I found her sitting
upon it. She flew off as I came up,
and I pushed into the scrub far enough to
thrust my hand into the nest, which, to my
disappointment, was empty. In fact, it was
still far from completed; for on the 3d of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">« 64 »</a></span>
March, when I paid it a farewell visit, its
owner was still at work lining it with fine
grass. At that time it was a comfortable-looking
and really elaborate structure.
Both the birds came to look at me as I stood
on the piazza. They perched together on
the top of a stake so narrow that there was
scarcely room for their feet; and as they
stood thus, side by side, one of them struck
its beak several times against the beak of
the other, as if in play. I wished them joy
of their expected progeny, and was the more
ready to believe they would have it for this
little display of sportive sentimentality.</p>

<p>It was a distinguished company that frequented
that row of narrow back yards on
the edge of the sand-hills. As a new-comer,
I found the jays (sometimes there were ten
under my eye at once) the most entertaining
members of it, but if I had been a
dweller there for the summer, I should perhaps
have altered my opinion; for the group
contained four of the finest of Floridian
songsters,&mdash;the mocking-bird, the brown
thrasher, the cardinal grosbeak, and the
Carolina wren. Rare morning and evening
concerts those cottagers must have. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">« 65 »</a></span>
besides these there were catbirds, ground
doves, red-eyed chewinks, white-eyed chewinks,
a song sparrow (one of the few that
I saw in Florida), savanna sparrows, myrtle
birds, redpoll warblers, a ph&#339;be, and two
flickers. The last-named birds, by the way,
are never backward about displaying their
tender feelings. A treetop flirtation is their
special delight (I hope my readers have all
seen one; few things of the sort are better
worth looking at), and here, in the absence
of trees, they had taken to the ridgepole of
a house.</p>

<p>More than once I remarked white-breasted
swallows straggling northward along the line
of sand-hills. They were in loose order, but
the movement was plainly concerted, with
all the look of a vernal migration. This
swallow, the first of its family to arrive in
New England, remains in Florida throughout
the winter, but is known also to go as
far south as Central America. The purple
martins&mdash;which, so far as I am aware, do
not winter in Florida&mdash;had already begun
to make their appearance. While crossing
the bridge, February 22, I was surprised to
notice two of them sitting upon a bird-box
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span>
over the draw, which just then stood open
for the passage of a tug-boat. The toll-gatherer
told me they had come &ldquo;from some
place&rdquo; eight or ten days before. His attention
had been called to them by his cat, who
was trying to get up to the box to bid them
welcome. He believed that she discovered
them within three minutes of their arrival.
It seemed not unlikely. In its own way a
cat is a pretty sharp ornithologist.</p>

<p>One or two cormorants were almost always
about the river. Sometimes they sat
upon stakes in a patriotic, spread-eagle
(American eagle) attitude, as if drying
their wings,&mdash;a curious sight till one became
accustomed to it. Snakebirds and
buzzards resort to the same device, but I
cannot recall ever seeing any Northern bird
thus engaged. From the south bridge I one
morning saw, to my great satisfaction, a
couple of white pelicans, the only ones that
I found in Florida, though I was assured
that within twenty years they had been common
along the Halifax and Hillsborough
rivers. My birds were flying up the river
at a good height. The brown pelicans, on
the other hand, made their daily pilgrimages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">« 67 »</a></span>
just above the level of the water, as has
been already described, and were never over
the river, but off the beach.</p>

<p>All in all, there are few pleasanter walks
in Florida, I believe, than the beach-round
at Daytona, out by one bridge and back by
the other. An old hotel-keeper&mdash;a rural
Yankee, if one could tell anything by his
look and speech&mdash;said to me in a burst of
confidence, &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ve got a climate, and
that&rsquo;s about all we have got,&mdash;climate and
sand.&rdquo; I could not entirely agree with him.
For myself, I found not only fine days, but
fine prospects. But there was no denying
the sand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wherever</span> a walker lives, he finds sooner
or later one favorite road. So it was with
me at New Smyrna, where I lived for three
weeks. I had gone there for the sake of
the river, and my first impulse was to take
the road that runs southerly along its bank.
At the time I thought it the most beautiful
road I had found in Florida, nor have I seen
any great cause since to alter that opinion.
With many pleasant windings (beautiful
roads are never straight, nor unnecessarily
wide, which is perhaps the reason why our
rural authorities devote themselves so madly
to the work of straightening and widening),&mdash;with
many pleasant windings, I say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The grace of God made manifest in curves,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>it follows the edge of the hammock, having
the river on one side, and the forest on the
other. It was afternoon when I first saw it.
Then it is shaded from the sun, while the
river and its opposite bank have on them a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span>
light more beautiful than can be described
or imagined; a light&mdash;with reverence for
the poet of nature be it spoken&mdash;a light
that never was <i>except</i> on sea or land. The
poet&rsquo;s dream was never equal to it.</p>

<p>In a flat country stretches of water are
doubly welcome. They take the place of
hills, and give the eye what it craves,&mdash;distance;
which softens angles, conceals details,
and heightens colors,&mdash;in short, transfigures
the world with its romancer&rsquo;s touch,
and blesses us with illusion. So, as I loitered
along the south road, I never tired of
looking across the river to the long, wooded
island, and over that to the line of sand-hills
that marked the eastern rim of the East
Peninsula, beyond which was the Atlantic.
The white crests of the hills made the
sharper points of the horizon line. Elsewhere
clumps of nearer pine-trees intervened,
while here and there a tall palmetto stood,
or seemed to stand, on the highest and farthest
ridge looking seaward. But particulars
mattered little. The blue water, the
pale, changeable grayish-green of the low
island woods, the deeper green of the pines,
the unnameable hues of the sky, the sunshine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">« 70 »</a></span>
that flooded it all, these were beauty
enough;&mdash;beauty all the more keenly enjoyed
because for much of the way it was
seen only by glimpses, through vistas of palmetto
and live-oak. Sometimes the road
came quite out of the woods, as it rounded a
turn of the hammock. Then I stopped to
gaze long at the scene. Elsewhere I pushed
through the hedge at favorable points, and
sat, or stood, looking up and down the river.
A favorite seat was the prow of an old rowboat,
which lay, falling to pieces, high and
dry upon the sand. It had made its last
cruise, but I found it still useful.</p>

<p>The river is shallow. At low tide sand-bars
and oyster-beds occupy much of its
breadth; and even when it looked full, a
great blue heron would very likely be wading
in the middle of it. That was a sight
to which I had grown accustomed in Florida,
where this bird, familiarly known as &ldquo;the
major,&rdquo; is apparently ubiquitous. Too big
to be easily hidden, it is also, as a general
thing, too wary to be approached within
gunshot. I am not sure that I ever came
within sight of one, no matter how suddenly
or how far away, that it did not give evidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">« 71 »</a></span>
of having seen me first. Long legs,
long wings, a long bill&mdash;and long sight and
long patience: such is the tall bird&rsquo;s dowry.
Good and useful qualities, all of them.
Long may they avail to put off the day of
their owner&rsquo;s extermination.</p>

<p>The major is scarcely a bird of which you
can make a pet in your mind, as you may
of the chickadee, for instance, or the bluebird,
or the hermit thrush. He does not
lend himself naturally to such imaginary endearments.
But it is pleasant to have him
on one&rsquo;s daily beat. I should count it one
compensation for having to live in Florida
instead of in Massachusetts (but I might
require a good many others) that I should
see him a hundred times as often. In walking
down the river road I seldom saw less
than half a dozen; not together (the major,
like fishermen in general, is of an unsocial
turn), but here one and there one,&mdash;on a
sand-bar far out in the river, or in some
shallow bay, or on the submerged edge of
an oyster-flat. Wherever he was, he always
looked as if he might be going to do something
presently; even now, perhaps, the
matter was on his mind; but at this moment&mdash;well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span>
there are times when a heron&rsquo;s
strength is to stand still. Certainly he
seemed in no danger of overeating. A
cracker told me that the major made an
excellent dish if killed on the full of the
moon. I wondered at that qualification,
but my informant explained himself. The
bird, he said, feeds mostly at night, and
fares best with the moon to help him. If
the reader would dine off roast blue heron,
therefore, as I hope I never shall, let him
mind the lunar phases. But think of the
gastronomic ups and downs of a bird that is
fat and lean by turns twelve times a year!
Possibly my informant overstated the case;
but in any event I would trust the major to
bear himself like a philosopher. If there is
any one of God&rsquo;s creatures that can wait for
what he wants, it must be the great blue
heron.</p>

<p>I have spoken of his caution. If he was
patrolling a shallow on one side of an
oyster-bar,&mdash;at the rate, let us say, of two
steps a minute,&mdash;and took it into his head
(an inappropriate phrase, as conveying an
idea of something like suddenness) to try
the water on the other side, he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">« 73 »</a></span>
spread his wings, as a matter of course, and
fly over. First he put up his head&mdash;an
operation that makes another bird of him&mdash;and
looked in all directions. How could he
tell what enemy might be lying in wait?
And having alighted on the other side (his
manner of alighting is one of his prettiest
characteristics), he did not at once draw in
his neck till his bill protruded on a level
with his body, and resume his labors, but
first he looked once more all about him. It
was a good <i>habit</i> to do that, anyhow, and
he meant to run no risks. If &ldquo;the race
of birds was created out of innocent, light-minded
men, whose thoughts were directed
toward heaven,&rdquo; according to the word of
Plato, then <i>Ardea herodias</i> must long ago
have fallen from grace. I imagine his state
of mind to be always like that of our pilgrim
fathers in times of Indian massacres.
When they went after the cows or to hoe the
corn, they took their guns with them, and
turned no corner without a sharp lookout
against ambush. No doubt such a condition
of affairs has this advantage, that it
makes ennui impossible. There is always
something to live for, if it be only to avoid
getting killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">« 74 »</a></span></p>

<p>After this manner did the Hillsborough
River majors all behave themselves until my
very last walk beside it. Then I found the
exception,&mdash;the exception that is as good
as inevitable in the case of any bird, if
the observation be carried far enough. He
(or she; there was no telling which it was)
stood on the sandy beach, a splendid creature
in full nuptial garb, two black plumes
nodding jauntily from its crown, and masses
of soft elongated feathers draping its back
and lower neck. Nearer and nearer I approached,
till I must have been within a
hundred feet; but it stood as if on dress
parade, exulting to be looked at. Let us
hope it never carried itself thus gayly when
the wrong man came along.</p>

<p>Near the major&mdash;not keeping him company,
but feeding in the same shallows
and along the same oyster-bars&mdash;were constantly
to be seen two smaller relatives
of his, the little blue heron and the Louisiana.
The former is what is called a dichromatic
species; some of the birds are blue,
and others white. On the Hillsborough,
it seemed to me that white specimens predominated;
but possibly that was because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">« 75 »</a></span>
they were so much more conspicuous. Sunlight
favors the white feather; no other color
shows so quickly or so far. If you are on
the beach and catch sight of a bird far
out at sea,&mdash;a gull or a tern, a gannet or
a loon,&mdash;it is invariably the white parts
that are seen first. And so the little white
heron might stand never so closely against
the grass or the bushes on the further shore
of the river, and the eye could not miss him.
If he had been a blue one, art that distance,
ten to one he would have escaped me. Besides,
I was more on the alert for white ones,
because I was always hoping to find one of
them with black legs. In other words, I
was looking for the little white egret, a bird
concerning which, thanks to the murderous
work of plume-hunters,&mdash;thanks, also, to
those good women who pay for having the
work done,&mdash;I must confess that I went
to Florida and came home again without
certainly seeing it.</p>

<p>The heron with which I found myself especially
taken was the Louisiana; a bird of
about the same size as the little blue, but
with an air of daintiness and lightness that
is quite its own, and quite indescribable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">« 76 »</a></span>
When it rose upon the wing, indeed, it
seemed almost <i>too</i> light, almost unsteady, as
if it lacked ballast, like a butterfly. It was
the most numerous bird of its tribe along
the river, I think, and, with one exception,
the most approachable. That exception was
the green heron, which frequented the flats
along the village front, and might well have
been mistaken for a domesticated bird; letting
you walk across a plank directly over
its head while it squatted upon the mud, and
when disturbed flying into a fig-tree before
the hotel piazza, just as the dear little ground
doves were in the habit of doing. To me,
who had hitherto seen the green heron in
the wildest of places, this tameness was an
astonishing sight. It would be hard to say
which surprised me more, the New Smyrna
green herons or the St. Augustine sparrow-hawks,&mdash;which
latter treated me very much
as I am accustomed to being treated by village-bred
robins in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The Louisiana heron was my favorite, as
I say, but incomparably the handsomest
member of the family (I speak of such as I
saw) was the great white egret. In truth,
the epithet &ldquo;handsome&rdquo; seems almost a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">« 77 »</a></span>
vulgarism as applied to a creature so superb,
so utterly and transcendently splendid. I
saw it&mdash;in a way to be sure of it&mdash;only
once. Then, on an island in the Hillsborough,
two birds stood in the dead tops of
low shrubby trees, fully exposed in the
most favorable of lights, their long dorsal
trains drooping behind them and swaying
gently in the wind. I had never seen anything
so magnificent. And when I returned,
two or three hours afterward, from a jaunt
up the beach to Mosquito Inlet, there they
still were, as if they had not stirred in all
that time. The reader should understand
that this egret is between four and five feet
in length, and measures nearly five feet from
wing tip to wing tip, and that its plumage
throughout is of spotless white. It is pitiful
to think how constantly a bird of that size
and color must be in danger of its life.</p>

<p>Happily, the lawmakers of the State have
done something of recent years for the protection
of such defenseless beauties. Happily,
too, shooting from the river boats is no
longer permitted,&mdash;on the regular lines,
that is. I myself saw a young gentleman
stand on the deck of an excursion steamer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">« 78 »</a></span>
with a rifle, and do his worst to kill or maim
every living thing that came in sight, from
a spotted sandpiper to a turkey buzzard! I
call him a &ldquo;gentleman;&rdquo; he was in gentle
company, and the fact that he chewed gum
industriously would, I fear, hardly invalidate
his claim to that title. The narrow
river wound in and out between low, densely
wooded banks, and the beauty of the shifting
scene was enough almost to take one&rsquo;s
breath away; but the crack of the rifle
was not the less frequent on that account.
Perhaps the sportsman was a Southerner,
to whom river scenery of that enchanting
kind was an old story. More likely he was
a Northerner, one of the men who thank
Heaven they are &ldquo;not sentimental.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In my rambles up and down the river
road I saw few water birds beside the herons.
Two or three solitary cormorants would
be shooting back and forth at a furious rate,
or swimming in midstream; and sometimes
a few spotted sandpipers and killdeer plovers
were feeding along the shore. Once in
a great while a single gull or tern made its
appearance,&mdash;just often enough to keep
me wondering why they were not there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">« 79 »</a></span>
oftener,&mdash;and one day a water-turkey went
suddenly over my head and dropped into
the river on the farther side of the island,
I was glad to see this interesting creature
for once in salt water; for the Hillsborough,
like the Halifax and the Indian rivers,
is a river in name only,&mdash;a river by brevet,
&mdash;being, in fact, a salt-water lagoon or
sound between the mainland and the eastern
peninsula.</p>

<p>Fish-hawks were always in sight, and
bald eagles were seldom absent altogether.
Sometimes an eagle stood perched on a dead
tree on an island. Oftener I heard a
scream, and looked up to see one sailing far
overhead, or chasing an osprey. On one
such occasion, when the hawk seemed to be
making a losing fight, a third bird suddenly
intervened, and the eagle, as I thought, was
driven away. &ldquo;Good for the brotherhood
of fish-hawks!&rdquo; I exclaimed. But at that
moment I put my glass on the new-comer;
and behold, he was not a hawk, but another
eagle. Meanwhile the hawk had disappeared
with his fish, and I was left to ponder
the mystery.</p>

<p>As for the wood, the edge of the hammock,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">« 80 »</a></span>
through which the road passes, there
were no birds in it. It was one of those
places (I fancy every bird-gazer must have
had experience of such) where it is a waste
of time to seek them. I could walk down
the road for two miles and back again, and
then sit in my room at the hotel for fifteen
minutes, and see more wood birds, and more
kinds of them, in one small live-oak before
the window than I had seen in the whole
four miles; and that not once and by accident,
but again and again. In affairs of this
kind it is useless to contend. The spot looks
favorable, you say, and nobody can deny it;
there must be birds there, plenty of them;
your missing them to-day was a matter of
chance; you will try again. And you try
again&mdash;and again&mdash;and yet again. But
in the end you have to acknowledge that,
for some reason unknown to you, the birds
have agreed to give that place the go-by.</p>

<p>One bird, it is true, I found in this hammock,
and not elsewhere: a single oven-bird,
which, with one Northern water thrush and
one Louisiana water thrush, completed my
set of Florida <i>Seiuri</i>. Besides him I recall
one hermit thrush, a few cedar-birds, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span>
house wren, chattering at a great rate
among the &ldquo;bootjacks&rdquo; (leaf-stalks) of an
overturned palmetto-tree, with an occasional
mocking-bird, cardinal grosbeak, prairie
warbler, yellow redpoll, myrtle bird, ruby-crowned
kinglet, ph&#339;be, and flicker. In
short, there were no birds at all, except now
and then an accidental straggler of a kind
that could be found almost anywhere else in
indefinite numbers.</p>

<p>And as it was not the presence of birds
that made the river road attractive, so neither
was it any unwonted display of blossoms.
Beside a similar road along the
bank of the Halifax, in Daytona, grew multitudes
of violets, and goodly patches of purple
verbena (garden plants gone wild, perhaps),
and a fine profusion of spiderwort,&mdash;a
pretty flower, the bluest of the blue,
thrice welcome to me as having been one of
the treasures of the very first garden of
which I have any remembrance. &ldquo;Indigo
plant,&rdquo; we called it then. Here, however,
on the way from New Smyrna to Hawks
Park, I recall no violets, nor any verbena
or spiderwort. Yellow wood-sorrel (oxalis)
was here, of course, as it was everywhere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">« 82 »</a></span>
It dotted the grass in Florida very much as
five-fingers do in Massachusetts, I sometimes
thought. And the creeping, round-leaved
houstonia was here, with a superfluity of a
weedy blue sage (<i>Salvia lyrata</i>). Here,
also, as in Daytona, I found a strikingly
handsome tufted plant, a highly varnished
evergreen, which I persisted in taking for
a fern&mdash;the sterile fronds&mdash;in spite of
repeated failures to find it described by
Dr. Chapman under that head, until at last
an excellent woman came to my help with
the information that it was &ldquo;coontie&rdquo; (<i>Zamia
integrifolia</i>), famous as a plant out
of which the Southern people made bread
in war time. This confession of botanical
amateurishness and incompetency will be
taken, I hope, as rather to my credit than
otherwise; but it would be morally worthless
if I did not add the story of another
plant, which, in this same New Smyrna
hammock, I frequently noticed hanging in
loose bunches, like blades of flaccid deep
green grass, from the trunks of cabbage
palmettos. The tufts were always out of
reach, and I gave them no particular
thought; and it was not until I got home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">« 83 »</a></span>
to Massachusetts, and then almost by accident,
that I learned what they were. They,
it turned out, <i>were</i> ferns (<i>Vittaria lineata</i>&mdash;grass
fern), and my discomfiture was
complete.</p>

<p>This comparative dearth of birds and flowers
was not in all respects a disadvantage.
On the contrary, to a naturalist blessed now
and then with a supernaturalistic mood, it
made the place, on occasion, a welcome retreat.
Thus, one afternoon, as I remember,
I had been reading Keats, the only book I
had brought with me,&mdash;not counting manuals,
of course, which come under another
head,&mdash;and by and by started once more
for the pine lands by the way of the cotton-shed
hammock, &ldquo;to see what I could see.&rdquo;
But poetry had spoiled me just then for
anything like scientific research, and as I
waded through the ankle-deep sand I said
to myself all at once, &ldquo;No, no! What do
I care for another new bird? I want to
see the beauty of the world.&rdquo; With that I
faced about, and, taking a side track, made
as directly as possible for the river road.
There I should have a mind at ease, with no
unfamiliar, tantalizing bird note to set my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">« 84 »</a></span>
curiosity on edge, nor any sand through
which to be picking my steps.</p>

<p>The river road is paved with oyster-shells.
If any reader thinks that statement prosaic
or unimportant, then he has never lived in
southern Florida. In that part of the world
all new-comers have to take walking-lessons;
unless, indeed, they have already served an
apprenticeship on Cape Cod, or in some other
place equally arenarious. My own lesson I
got at second hand, and on a Sunday. It
was at New Smyrna, in the village. Two
women were behind me, on their way home
from church, and one of them was complaining
of the sand, to which she was not yet
used. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I found it
pretty hard walking at first, but I learned
after a while that the best way is to set the
heel down hard, as hard as you can; then
the sand doesn&rsquo;t give under you so much,
and you get along more comfortably.&rdquo; I
wonder whether she noticed, just in front
of her, a man who began forthwith to bury
his boot heel at every step?</p>

<p>In such a country (the soil is said to be
good for orange-trees, but they do not have
to walk) roads of powdered shell are veritable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">« 85 »</a></span>
luxuries, and land agents are quite
right in laying all stress upon them as inducements
to possible settlers. If the author
of the Apocalypse had been raised in Florida,
we should never have had the streets of the
New Jerusalem paved with gold. His idea
of heaven would have been different from
that; more personal and home-felt, we may
be certain.</p>

<p>The river road, then, as I have said, and
am glad to say again, was shell-paved. And
well it might be; for the hammock, along
the edge of which it meandered, seemed, in
some places at least, to be little more than a
pile of oyster-shells, on which soil had somehow
been deposited, and over which a forest
was growing. Florida Indians have left an
evil memory. I heard a philanthropic visitor
lamenting that she had talked with many of
the people about them, and had yet to hear
a single word said in their favor. Somebody
might have been good enough to say that,
with all their faults, they had given to
eastern Florida a few hills, such as they are,
and at present are supplying it, indirectly,
with comfortable highways. How they must
have feasted, to leave such heaps of shells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span>
behind them! They came to the coast on
purpose, we may suppose. Well, the red-men
are gone, but the oyster-beds remain;
and if winter refugees continue to pour in
this direction, as doubtless they will, they
too will eat a &ldquo;heap&rdquo; of oysters (it is easy
to see how the vulgar Southern use of that
word may have originated), and in the
course of time, probably, the shores of the
Halifax and the Hillsborough will be a fine
mountainous country! And then, if this
ancient, nineteenth-century prediction is remembered,
the highest peak of the range
will perhaps be named in a way which the
innate modesty of the prophet restrains him
from specifying with greater particularity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it is long to wait, and tourists
and residents alike must find what comfort
they can in the lesser hills which, thanks to
the good appetite of their predecessors, are
already theirs. For my own part, there is
one such eminence of which I cherish the
most grateful recollections. It stands (or
stood; the road-makers had begun carting
it away) at a bend in the road just south of
one of the Turnbull canals. I climbed it
often (it can hardly be less than fifteen or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">« 87 »</a></span>
twenty feet above the level of the sea), and
spent more than one pleasant hour upon its
grassy summit. Northward was New Smyrna,
a village in the woods, and farther away
towered the lighthouse of Mosquito Inlet.
Along the eastern sky stretched the long
line of the peninsula sand-hills, between the
white crests of which could be seen the rude
cottages of Coronado beach. To the south
and west was the forest, and in front, at my
feet, lay the river with its woody islands.
Many times have I climbed a mountain
and felt myself abundantly repaid by an off-look
less beautiful. This was the spot to
which I turned when I had been reading
Keats, and wanted to see the beauty of the
world. Here were a grassy seat, the shadow
of orange-trees, and a wide prospect. In
Florida, I found no better place in which a
man who wished to be both a naturalist and
a nature-lover, who felt himself heir to a
double inheritance,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The clear eye&rsquo;s moiety and the dear heart&rsquo;s part,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>could for the time sit still and be happy.</p>

<p>The orange-trees yielded other things beside
shadow, though perhaps nothing better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">« 88 »</a></span>
than that. They were resplendent with
fruit, and on my earlier visits were also in
bloom. One did not need to climb the hill
to learn the fact. For an out-of-door sweetness
it would be hard, I think, to improve
upon the scent of orange blossoms. As for
the oranges themselves, they seemed to be
in little demand, large and handsome as they
were. Southern people in general, I fancy,
look upon wild fruit of this kind as not exactly
edible. I remember asking two colored
men in Tallahassee whether the oranges still
hanging conspicuously from a tree just over
the wall (a sight not so very common in
that part of the State) were sweet or sour.
I have forgotten just what they said, but I
remember how they <i>looked</i>. I meant the
inquiry as a mild bit of humor, but to them
it was a thousandfold better than that: it
was wit ineffable. What Shakespeare said
about the prosperity of a jest was never more
strikingly exemplified. In New Smyrna,
with orange groves on every hand, the wild
fruit went begging with natives and tourists
alike; so that I feel a little hesitancy about
confessing my own relish for it, lest I should
be accused of affectation. Not that I devoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">« 89 »</a></span>
wild oranges by the dozen, or in
place of sweet ones; one sour orange goes
a good way, as the common saying is; but I
ate them, nevertheless, or rather drank them,
and found them, in a thirsty hour, decidedly
refreshing.</p>

<p>The unusual coldness of the past season
(Florida winters, from what I heard about
them, must have fallen of late into a queer
habit of being regularly exceptional) had
made it difficult to buy sweet oranges that
were not dry and &ldquo;punky&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> toward the stem;
but the hardier wild fruit had weathered the
frost, and was so juicy that, as I say, you
did not so much eat one as drink it. As for
the taste, it was a wholesome bitter-sour, as
if a lemon had been flavored with quinine;
not quite so sour as a lemon, perhaps, nor
<i>quite</i> so bitter as Peruvian bark, but, as
it were, an agreeable compromise between
the two. When I drank one, I not only
quenched my thirst, but felt that I had
taken an infallible prophylactic against the
malarial fever. Better still, I had surprised
myself. For one who had felt a lifelong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">« 90 »</a></span>
distaste, unsocial and almost unmanly, for
the bitter drinks which humanity in general
esteems so essential to its health and comfort,
I was developing new and unexpected capabilities;
than which few things can be more
encouraging as years increase upon a man&rsquo;s
head, and the world seems to be closing in
about him.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> I have heard this useful word all my life, and now
am surprised to find it wanting in the dictionaries.</p></div>

<p>Later in the season, on this same shell
mound, I might have regaled myself with
fresh figs. Here, at any rate, was a thrifty-looking
fig-tree, though its crop, if it bore
one, would perhaps not have waited my coming
so patiently as the oranges had done.
Here, too, was a red cedar; and to me, who,
in my ignorance, had always thought of
this tough little evergreen as especially at
home on my own bleak and stony hillsides,
it seemed an incongruous trio,&mdash;fig-tree,
orange-tree, and savin. In truth, the cedars
of Florida were one of my liveliest surprises.
At first I refused to believe that they were
red cedars, so strangely exuberant were they,
so disdainful of the set, cone-shaped, toy-tree
pattern on which I had been used to seeing
red cedars built. And when at last a study
of the flora compelled me to admit their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">« 91 »</a></span>
identity,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I turned about and protested that
I had never seen red cedars before. One,
in St. Augustine, near San Marco Avenue,
I had the curiosity to measure. The girth
of the trunk at the smallest place was six
feet five inches, and the spread of the
branches was not less than fifty feet.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> I speak as if I had accepted my own study of the
manual as conclusive. I did for the time being, but
while writing this paragraph I bethought myself that
I might be in error, after all. I referred the question,
therefore, to a friend, a botanist of authority. &ldquo;No wonder
the red cedars of Florida puzzled you,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;No one would suppose at first that they were of the
same species as our New England savins. The habit is
entirely different; but botanists have found no characters
by which to separate them, and you are safe in considering
them as <i>Juniperus Virginiana</i>.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The stroller in this road suffered few distractions.
The houses, two or three to the
mile, stood well back in the woods, with
little or no cleared land about them. Picnic
establishments they seemed to a Northern
eye, rather than permanent dwellings. At
one point in the hammock, a rude camp was
occupied by a group of rough-looking men
and several small children, who seemed to
be getting on as best they could&mdash;none too
well, to judge from appearances&mdash;without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">« 92 »</a></span>
feminine ministrations. What they were
there for I never made out. They fished,
I think, but whether by way of amusement
or as a serious occupation I did not learn.
Perhaps, like the Indians of old, they had
come to the river for the oyster season.
They might have done worse. They never
paid the slightest attention to me, nor once
gave me any decent excuse for engaging
them in talk. The best thing I remember
about them was a tableau caught in passing.
A &ldquo;norther&rdquo; had descended upon us unexpectedly
(Florida is not a whit behind the
rest of the world in sudden changes of temperature),
and while hastening homeward,
toward nightfall, hugging myself to keep
warm, I saw, in the woods, this group of
campers disposed about a lively blaze.</p>

<p>Let us be thankful, say I, that memory
is so little the servant of the will. Chance
impressions of this kind, unforeseen, involuntary,
and inexplicable, make one of the
chief delights of traveling, or rather of having
traveled. In the present case, indeed,
the permanence of the impression is perhaps
not altogether beyond the reach of a plausible
conjecture. We have not always lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">« 93 »</a></span>
in houses; and if we love the sight of a fire
out-of-doors,&mdash;a camp-fire, that is to say,&mdash;as
we all do, so that the burning of a
brush-heap in a neighbor&rsquo;s yard will draw
us to the window, the feeling is but part of
an ancestral inheritance. We have come
by it honestly, as the phrase is. And so I
need not scruple to set down another reminiscence
of the same kind,&mdash;an early morning
street scene, of no importance in itself,
in the village of New Smyrna. It may
have been on the morning next after the
&ldquo;norther&rdquo; just mentioned. I cannot say.
We had two or three such touches of winter
in early March; none of them at all distressing,
be it understood, to persons in ordinary
health. One night water froze,&mdash;&ldquo;as thick
as a silver dollar,&rdquo;&mdash;and orange growers
were alarmed for the next season&rsquo;s crop, the
trees being just ready to blossom. Some
men kept fires burning in their orchards
overnight; a pretty spectacle, I should think,
especially where the fruit was still ungathered.
On one of these frosty mornings,
then, I saw a solitary horseman, not &ldquo;wending
his way,&rdquo; but warming his hands over a
fire that he had built for that purpose in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">« 94 »</a></span>
the village street. One might live and die
in a New England village without seeing
such a sight. A Yankee would have betaken
himself to the corner grocery. But
here, though that &ldquo;adjunct of civilization&rdquo;
was directly across the way, most likely it
had never had a stove in it. The sun would
give warmth enough in an hour,&mdash;by nine
o&rsquo;clock one would probably be glad of a
sunshade; but the man was chilly after his
ride; it was still a bit early to go about the
business that had brought him into town:
what more natural than to hitch his horse,
get together a few sticks, and kindle a blaze?
What an insane idea it would have seemed
to him that a passing stranger might remember
him and his fire three months
afterward, and think them worth talking
about in print! But then, as was long ago
said, it is the fate of some men to have
greatness thrust upon them.</p>

<p>This main street of the village, by the
way, with its hotels and shops, was no other
than my river road itself, in its more civilized
estate, as I now remember with a sense
of surprise. In my mind the two had never
any connection. It was in this thoroughfare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">« 95 »</a></span>
that one saw now and then a group
of cavaliers strolling about under broad-brimmed
hats, with big spurs at their heels,
accosting passers-by with hearty familiarity,
first names and hand-shakes, while their
horses stood hitched to the branches of roadside
trees,&mdash;a typical Southern picture.
Here, on a Sunday afternoon, were two
young fellows who had brought to town a
mother coon and three young ones, hoping
to find a purchaser. The guests at the
hotels manifested no eagerness for such
pets, but the colored bell-boys and waiters
gathered about, and after a little good-humored
dickering bought the entire lot, box
and all, for a dollar and a half; first having
pulled the little ones out between the slats&mdash;not
without some risk to both parties&mdash;to
look at them and pass them round. The
venders walked off with grins of ill-concealed
triumph. The Fates had been kind to them,
and they had three silver half-dollars in their
pockets. I heard one of them say something
about giving part of the money to a third
man who had told them where the nest was;
but his companion would listen to no such
folly. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t come with us,&rdquo; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">« 96 »</a></span>
said, &ldquo;and we won&rsquo;t tell him a damned
thing.&rdquo; I fear there was nothing distinctively
Southern about <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>Here, too, in the heart of the town, was
a magnificent cluster of live-oaks, worth
coming to Florida to see; far-spreading, full
of ferns and air-plants, and heavy with
hanging moss. Day after day I went
out to admire them. Under them was a
neglected orange grove, and in one of the
orange-trees, amid the glossy foliage, appeared
my first summer tanager. It was
a royal setting, and the splendid vermilion-red
bird was worthy of it. Among the
oaks I walked in the evening, listening to
the strange low chant of the chuck-will&rsquo;s-widow,&mdash;a
name which the owner himself
pronounces with a rest after the first syllable.
Once, for two or three days, the
trees were amazingly full of blue yellow-backed
warblers. Numbers of them, a
dozen at least, could be heard singing at
once directly over one&rsquo;s head, running up
the scale not one after another, but literally
in unison. Here the tufted titmouse, the
very soul of monotony, piped and piped
and piped, as if his diapason stop were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">« 97 »</a></span>
pulled out and stuck, and could not be
pushed in again. He is an odd genius.
With plenty of notes, he wearies you almost
to distraction, harping on one string
for half an hour together. He is the one
Southern bird that I should perhaps be
sorry to see common in Massachusetts; but
that &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; is a large word. Many
yellow-throated warblers, silent as yet, were
commonly in the live-oaks, and innumerable
myrtle birds, also silent, with prairie warblers,
black-and-white creepers, solitary vireos,
an occasional chickadee, and many more.
It was a birdy spot; and just across the
way, on the shrubby island, were red-winged
blackbirds, who piqued my curiosity by
adding to the familiar <i>conkaree</i> a final syllable,&mdash;the
Florida termination, I called
it,&mdash;which made me wonder whether, as
has been the case with so many other Florida
birds, they might not turn out to be a
distinct race, worthy of a name (<i>Agelaius
ph&#339;niceus something-or-other</i>), as well as of
a local habitation. I suggest the question
to those whose business it is to be learned in
such matters.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> My suggestion, I now discover,&mdash;since this paper was
first printed,&mdash;was some years too late. Mr. Ridgway,
in his <i>Manual of North American Birds</i> (1887), had already
described a subspecies of Florida red-wings under the
name of <i>Agelaius ph&#339;niceus bryanti</i>. Whether my New
Smyrna birds should come under that title cannot be told,
of course, in the absence of specimens; but on the strength
of the song I venture to think it highly probable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">« 98 »</a></span></p></div>

<p>The tall grass about the borders of the
island was alive with clapper rails. Before
I rose in the morning I heard them crying
in full chorus; and now and then during
the day something would happen, and all
at once they would break out with one
sharp volley, and then instantly all would
be silent again. Theirs is an apt name,&mdash;<i>Rallus
crepitans</i>. Once I watched two of
them in the act of crepitating, and ever
after that, when the sudden uproar burst
forth, I seemed to see the reeds full of
birds, each with his bill pointing skyward,
bearing his part in the salvo. So far as
I could perceive, they had nothing to fear
from human enemies. They ran about the
mud on the edge of the grass, especially
in the morning, looking like half-grown
pullets. Their specialty was crab-fishing,
at which they were highly expert, plunging
into the water up to the depth of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">« 99 »</a></span>
legs, and handling and swallowing pretty
large specimens with surprising dexterity.
I was greatly pleased with them, as well
as with their local name, &ldquo;everybody&rsquo;s
chickens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once I feared we had heard the last of
them. On a day following a sudden fall
of the mercury, a gale from the north set
in at noon, with thunder and lightning,
hail, and torrents of rain. The river was
quickly lashed into foam, and the gale
drove the ocean into it through the inlet,
till the shrubbery of the rails' island barely
showed above the breakers. The street was
deep under water, and fears were entertained
for the new bridge and the road to
the beach. All night the gale continued,
and all the next day till late in the afternoon;
and when the river should have been
at low tide, the island was still flooded.
Gravitation was overmatched for the time
being. And where were the rails, I asked
myself. They could swim, no doubt, when
put to it, but it seemed impossible that
they could survive so fierce an inundation.
Well, the wind ceased, the tide went out
at last; and behold, the rails were in full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">« 100 »</a></span>
cry, not a voice missing! How they had
managed it was beyond my ken.</p>

<p>Another island, farther out than that of
the rails (but the rails, like the long-billed
marsh wrens, appeared to be present in
force all up and down the river, in suitable
places), was occupied nightly as a crow-roost.
Judged by the morning clamor,
which, like that of the rails, I heard from
my bed, its population must have been enormous.
One evening I happened to come
up the street just in time to see the hinder
part of the procession&mdash;some hundreds of
birds&mdash;flying across the river. They came
from the direction of the pine lands in
larger and smaller squads, and with but a
moderate amount of noise moved straight
to their destination. All but one of them
so moved, that is to say. The performance
of that one exception was a mystery. He
rose high in the air, over the river, and
remained soaring all by himself, acting
sometimes as if he were catching insects,
till the flight had passed, even to the last
scattering detachments. What could be
the meaning of his eccentric behavior?
Some momentary caprice had taken him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">« 101 »</a></span>
perhaps. Or was he, as I could not help
asking, some duly appointed officer of the
day,&mdash;grand marshal, if you please,&mdash;with
a commission to see all hands in before
retiring himself? He waited, at any
rate, till the final stragglers had passed;
then he came down out of the air and followed
them. I meant to watch the ingathering
a second time, to see whether this feature
of it would be repeated, but I was
never there at the right moment. One cannot
do everything.</p>

<p>Now, alas, Florida seems very far off. I
am never likely to walk again under those
New Smyrna live-oaks, nor to see again all
that beauty of the Hillsborough. And yet,
in a truer and better sense of the word, I
do see it, and shall. What a heavenly light
falls at this moment on the river and the
island woods! Perhaps we must come back
to Wordsworth, after all,&mdash;</p>

<span class="caption2">A MORNING AT THE OLD SUGAR MILL.</span><a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>


<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> I have called the ruin here spoken of a &ldquo;sugar mill&rdquo;
for no better reason than because that is the name commonly
applied to it by the residents of the town. When
this sketch was written, I had never heard of a theory
since broached in some of our Northern newspapers,&mdash;I
know not by whom,&mdash;that the edifice in question was
built as a chapel, perhaps by Columbus himself! I should
be glad to believe it, and can only add my hope that he
will be shown to have built also the so-called sugar mill
a few miles north of New Smyrna, in the Dunlawton hammock
behind Port Orange. In that, to be sure, there is
still much old machinery, but perhaps its presence would
prove no insuperable objection to a theory so pleasing.
In matters of this kind, much depends upon subjective
considerations; in one sense, at least, &ldquo;all things are possible
to him that believeth.&rdquo; For my own part, I profess
no opinion. I am neither an archæologist nor an ecclesiastic,
and speak simply as a chance observer.</p></div>

<p>On the third or fourth day of my sojourn
at the Live Oak Inn, the lady of the house,
noticing my peripatetic habits, I suppose,
asked whether I had been to the old sugar
mill. The ruin is mentioned in the guide-books
as one of the historic features of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">« 103 »</a></span>
ancient settlement of New Smyrna, but I
had forgotten the fact, and was thankful to
receive a description of the place, as well as
of the road thither,&mdash;a rather blind road,
my informant said, with no houses at which
to inquire the way.</p>

<p>Two or three mornings afterward, I set
out in the direction indicated. If the route
proved to be half as vague as my good lady&rsquo;s
account of it had sounded, I should probably
never find the mill; but the walk would be
pleasant, and that, after all, was the principal
consideration, especially to a man who
just then cared more, or thought he did, for
a new bird or a new song than for an indefinite
number of eighteenth-century relics.</p>

<p>For the first half-mile the road follows
one of the old Turnbull canals dug through
the coquina stone which underlies the soil
hereabout; then, after crossing the railway,
it strikes to the left through a piece of truly
magnificent wood, known as the cotton-shed
hammock, because, during the war, cotton
was stored here in readiness for the blockade
runners of Mosquito Inlet. Better than
anything I had yet seen, this wood answered
to my idea of a semi-tropical forest: live-oaks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">« 104 »</a></span>
magnolias, palmettos, sweet gums,
maples, and hickories, with here and there a
long-leaved pine overtopping all the rest.
The palmettos, most distinctively Southern
of them all, had been badly used by their
hardier neighbors; they looked stunted, and
almost without exception had been forced
out of their normal perpendicular attitude.
The live-oaks, on the other hand, were noble
specimens; lofty and wide-spreading, elm-like
in habit, it seemed to me, though not
without the sturdiness which belongs as by
right to all oaks, and seldom or never to the
American elm.</p>

<p>What gave its peculiar tropical character
to the wood, however, was not so much the
trees as the profusion of plants that covered
them and depended from them: air-plants
(<i>Tillandsia</i>), large and small,&mdash;like pineapples,
with which they claim a family relationship,&mdash;the
exuberant hanging moss,
itself another air-plant, ferns, and vines.
The ferns, a species of polypody (&ldquo;resurrection
ferns,&rdquo; I heard them called), completely
covered the upper surface of many
of the larger branches, while the huge vines
twisted about the trunks, or, quite as often,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">« 105 »</a></span>
dropped straight from the treetops to the
ground.</p>

<p>In the very heart of this dense, dark forest
(a forest primeval, I should have said,
but I was assured that the ground had been
under cultivation so recently that, to a practiced
eye, the cotton-rows were still visible)
stood a grove of wild orange-trees, the handsome
fruit glowing like lamps amid the deep
green foliage. There was little other brightness.
Here and there in the undergrowth
were yellow jessamine vines, but already&mdash;March
11&mdash;they were past flowering.
Almost or quite the only blossom just now
in sight was the faithful round-leaved houstonia,
growing in small flat patches in the
sand on the edge of the road, with budding
partridge-berry&mdash;a Yankee in Florida&mdash;to
keep it company. Warblers and titmice
twittered in the leafy treetops, and butterflies
of several kinds, notably one gorgeous
creature in yellow and black, like a larger
and more resplendent Turnus, went fluttering
through the under-woods. I could have
believed myself in the heart of a limitless
forest; but Florida hammocks, so far as I
have seen, are seldom of great extent, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">« 106 »</a></span>
the road presently crossed another railway
track, and then, in a few rods more, came
out into the sunny pine-woods, as one might
emerge from a cathedral into the open day.
Two men were approaching in a wagon (except
on Sunday, I am not certain that I ever
met a foot passenger in the flat-woods), and
I improved the opportunity to make sure
of my course. &ldquo;Go about fifty yards,&rdquo; said
one of them, &ldquo;and turn to the right; then
about fifty yards more, and turn to the left.
<i>That</i> road will take you to the mill.&rdquo; Here
was a man who had traveled in the pine
lands,&mdash;where, of all places, it is easy to
get lost and hard to find yourself,&mdash;and
not only appreciated the value of explicit
instructions, but, being a Southerner, had
leisure enough and politeness enough to give
them. I thanked him, and sauntered on.
The day was before me, and the place was
lively with birds. Pine-wood sparrows, pine
warblers, and red-winged blackbirds were
in song; two red-shouldered hawks were
screaming, a flicker was shouting, a red-bellied
woodpecker cried <i>kur-r-r-r</i>, brown-headed
nuthatches were gossiping in the distance,
and suddenly I heard, what I never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">« 107 »</a></span>
thought to hear in a pinery, the croak of a
green heron. I turned quickly and saw him.
It was indeed he. What a friend is ignorance,
mother of all those happy surprises
which brighten existence as they pass, like
the butterflies of the wood. The heron was
at home, and I was the stranger. For there
was water near, as there is everywhere in
Florida; and subsequently, in this very
place, I met not only the green heron, but
three of his relatives,&mdash;the great blue, the
little blue, and the dainty Louisiana, more
poetically known (and worthy to wear the
name) as the &ldquo;Lady of the Waters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On this first occasion, however, the green
heron was speedily forgotten; for just then
I heard another note, unlike anything I had
ever heard before,&mdash;as if a great Northern
shrike had been struck with preternatural
hoarseness, and, like so many other victims
of the Northern winter, had betaken himself
to a sunnier clime. I looked up. In the
leafy top of a pine sat a boat-tailed grackle,
splendidly iridescent, engaged in a musical
performance which afterward became almost
too familiar to me, but which now, as a
novelty, was as interesting as it was grotesque.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">« 108 »</a></span>
This, as well as I can describe it,
is what the bird was doing. He opened his
bill,&mdash;<i>set</i> it, as it were, wide apart,&mdash;and
holding it thus, emitted four or five rather
long and very loud grating, shriekish notes;
then instantly shook his wings with an extraordinary
flapping noise, and followed that
with several highly curious and startling
cries, the concluding one of which sometimes
suggested the cackle of a robin. All this
he repeated again and again with the utmost
fervor. He could not have been more enthusiastic
if he had been making the sweetest
music in the world. And I confess that
I thought he had reason to be proud of
his work. The introduction of wing-made
sounds in the middle of a vocal performance
was of itself a stroke of something like
genius. It put me in mind of the firing of
cannons as an accompaniment to the Anvil
Chorus. Why should a creature of such
gifts be named for his bodily dimensions, or
the shape of his tail? Why not <i>Quiscalus
gilmorius</i>, Gilmore&rsquo;s grackle?</p>

<p>That the sounds <i>were</i> wing-made I had
no thought of questioning. I had seen the
thing done,&mdash;seen it and heard it; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">« 109 »</a></span>
what shall a man trust, if not his own eyes
and ears, especially when each confirms the
other? Two days afterward, nevertheless,
I began to doubt. I heard a grackle &ldquo;sing&rdquo;
in the manner just described, wing-beats and
all, while flying from one tree to another;
and later still, in a country where boat-tailed
grackles were an every-day sight near the
heart of the village, I more than once saw
them produce the sounds in question without
any perceptible movement of the wings,
and furthermore, their mandibles could be
seen moving in time with the beats. So
hard is it to be sure of a thing, even when
you see it and hear it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; some sharp-witted reader will
say, &ldquo;you saw the wings flapping,&mdash;beating
time,&mdash;and so you imagined that the
sounds were like wing-beats.&rdquo; But for once
the sharp-witted reader is in the wrong.
The resemblance is not imaginary. Mr. F.
M. Chapman, in A List of Birds Observed
at Gainesville, Florida,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> says of the boat-tailed
grackle (<i>Quiscalus major</i>): "A singular
note of this species greatly resembles
the flapping of wings, as of a coot tripping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">« 110 »</a></span>
over the water; this sound was very familiar
to me, but so excellent is the imitation that
for a long time I attributed it to one of the
numerous coots which abound in most places
favored by <i>Q. major</i>."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> <i>The Auk</i>, vol. v. p. 273.</p></div>

<p>If the sounds are not produced by the
wings, the question returns, of course, why
the wings are shaken just at the right instant.
To that I must respond with the
time-honored formula, &ldquo;Not prepared.&rdquo;
The reader may believe, if he will, that
the bird is aware of the imitative quality
of the notes, and amuses itself by heightening
the delusion of the looker-on. My own
more commonplace conjecture is that the
sounds are produced by snappings and gratings
of the big mandibles (&ldquo;He is gritting
his teeth,&rdquo; said a shrewd unornithological
Yankee, whose opinion I had solicited), and
that the wing movements may be nothing
but involuntary accompaniments of this almost
convulsive action of the beak. But
perhaps the sounds <i>are</i> wing-made, after all.</p>

<p>On the day of which I am writing, at
any rate, I was troubled by no misgivings.
I had seen something new, and was only
desirous to see more of it. Who does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">« 111 »</a></span>
love an original character? For at least
half an hour the old mill was forgotten,
while I chased the grackle about, as he flew
hither and thither, sometimes with a loggerhead
shrike in furious pursuit. Once I had
gone a few rods into the palmetto scrub,
partly to be nearer the bird, but still more
to enjoy the shadow of a pine, and was
standing under the tree, motionless, when a
man came along the road in a gig. &ldquo;Surveying?&rdquo;
he asked, reining in his horse.
&ldquo;No, sir; I am looking at a bird in the
tree yonder.&rdquo; I wished him to go on, and
thought it best to gratify his curiosity at
once. He was silent a moment; then he
said, &ldquo;Looking at the old sugar house from
there?&rdquo; That was too preposterous, and
I answered with more voice, and perhaps
with a touch of impatience, &ldquo;No, no; I
am trying to see a bird in that pine-tree.&rdquo;
He was silent again. Then he gathered up
the reins. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so deaf I can&rsquo;t hear you,&rdquo;
he said, and drove on. &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; I remarked,
in a needless undertone; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
a good man, I&rsquo;ve no doubt, but deaf people
shouldn&rsquo;t be inquisitive at long range.&rdquo;
The advice was sound enough, in itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">« 112 »</a></span>
considered; properly understood, it might
be held to contain, or at least to suggest,
one of the profoundest, and at the same
time one of the most practical, truths of all
devout philosophy; but the testiness of its
tone was little to my credit. He was a
good man,&mdash;and the village doctor,&mdash;and
more than once afterward put me under
obligation. One of his best appreciated
favors was unintended and indirect. I was
driving with him through the hammock,
and we passed a bit of swamp. &ldquo;There
are some pretty flowers,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;I
think I must get them.&rdquo; At the word he
jumped out of the gig, bade me do the same,
hitched his horse, a half-broken stallion, to
a sapling, and plunged into the thicket. I
strolled elsewhere; and by and by he came
back, a bunch of common blue iris in one
hand, and his shoes and stockings in the
other. &ldquo;They are very pretty,&rdquo; he explained
(he spoke of the flowers), &ldquo;and it
is early for them.&rdquo; After that I had no
doubt of his goodness, and in case of need
would certainly have called him rather than
his younger rival at the opposite end of the
village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">« 113 »</a></span></p>

<p>When I tired of chasing the grackle, or
the shrike had driven him away (I do not
remember now how the matter ended), I
started again toward the old sugar mill.
Presently a lone cabin came into sight.
The grass-grown road led straight to it, and
stopped at the gate. Two women and a
brood of children stood in the door, and in answer
to my inquiry one of the women (the
children had already scampered out of sight)
invited me to enter the yard. &ldquo;Go round
the house,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you will find a
road that runs right down to the mill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mill, as it stands, is not much to
look at: some fragments of wall built of
coquina stone, with two or three arched windows
and an arched door, the whole surrounded
by a modern plantation of orange-trees,
now almost as much a ruin as the mill
itself. But the mill was built more than a
hundred years ago, and serves well enough
the principal use of abandoned and decaying
things,&mdash;to touch the imagination.
For myself, I am bound to say, it was a
precious two hours that I passed beside it,
seated on a crumbling stone in the shade of
a dying orange-tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">« 114 »</a></span></p>

<p>Behind me a redbird was whistling (cardinal
grosbeak, I have been accustomed to
call him, but I like the Southern name better,
in spite of its ambiguity), now in eager,
rapid tones, now slowly and with a dying
fall. Now his voice fell almost to a whisper,
now it rang out again; but always it
was sweet and golden, and always the bird
was out of sight in the shrubbery. The
orange-trees were in bloom; the air was
full of their fragrance, full also of the murmur
of bees. All at once a deeper note
struck in, and I turned to look. A humming-bird
was hovering amid the white
blossoms and glossy leaves. 1 saw his
flaming throat, and the next instant he was
gone, like a flash of light,&mdash;the first hummer
of the year. I was far from home, and
expectant of new things. That, I dare say,
was the reason why I took the sound at first
for the boom of a bumble-bee; some strange
Floridian bee, with a deeper and more melodious
bass than any Northern insect is
master of.</p>

<p>It is good to be here, I say to myself, and
we need no tabernacle. All things are in
harmony. A crow in the distance says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">« 115 »</a></span>
<i>caw</i>, <i>caw</i> in a meditative voice, as if he, too,
were thinking of clays past; and not even
the scream of a hen-hawk, off in the pine-woods,
breaks the spell that is upon us. A
quail whistles,&mdash;a true Yankee Bob White,
to judge him by his voice,&mdash;and the white-eyed
chewink (he is <i>not</i> a Yankee) whistles
and sings by turns. The bluebird&rsquo;s warble
and the pine warbler&rsquo;s trill could never be
disturbing to the quietest mood. Only one
voice seems out of tune: the white-eyed
vireo, even to-day, cannot forget his saucy
accent. But he soon falls silent. Perhaps,
after all, he feels himself an intruder.</p>

<p>The morning is cloudless and warm, till
suddenly, as if a door had been opened eastward,
the sea breeze strikes me. Henceforth
the temperature is perfect as I sit in
the shadow. I think neither of heat nor of
cold. I catch a glimpse of a beautiful leaf-green
lizard on the gray trunk of an orange-tree,
but it is gone (I wonder where) almost
before I can say I saw it. Presently a
brown one, with light-colored stripes and a
bluish tail, is seen traveling over the crumbling
wall, running into crannies and out
again. Now it stops to look at me with its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">« 116 »</a></span>
jewel of an eye. And there, on the rustic
arbor, is a third one, matching the unpainted
wood in hue. Its throat is white,
but when it is inflated, as happens every
few seconds, it turns to the loveliest rose
color. This inflated membrane should be
a vocal sac, I think, but I hear no sound.
Perhaps the chameleon&rsquo;s voice is too fine for
dull human sense.</p>

<p>On two sides of me, beyond the orange-trees,
is a thicket of small oaks and cabbage
palmettos,&mdash;hammock, I suppose it
is called. In all other directions are the
pine-woods, with their undergrowth of saw
palmetto. The cardinal sings from the
hammock, and so does the Carolina wren.
The chewinks, the blackbirds (a grackle just
now flies over, and a fish-hawk, also), with
the bluebirds and the pine warblers, are in
the pinery. From the same place comes
the song of a Maryland yellow-throat.
There, too, the hen-hawks are screaming.</p>

<p>At my feet are blue violets and white
houstonia. Vines, thinly covered with fresh
leaves, straggle over the walls,&mdash;Virginia
creeper, poison ivy, grapevine, and at least
one other, the name of which I do not know.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">« 117 »</a></span>
A clump of tall blackberry vines is full of
white blossoms, &ldquo;bramble roses faint and
pale,&rdquo; and in one corner is a tuft of scarlet
blooms,&mdash;sage, perhaps, or something akin
to it. For the moment I feel no curiosity.
But withal the place is unkempt, as becomes
a ruin. &ldquo;Winter&rsquo;s ragged hand&rdquo;
has been rather heavy upon it. Withered
palmetto leaves and leaf-stalks litter the
ground, and of course, being in Florida,
there is no lack of orange-peel lying about.
Ever since I entered the State a new Scripture
text has been running in my head: In
the place where the orange-peel falleth,
there shall it lie.</p>

<p>The mill, as I said, is now the centre of
an orange grove. There must be hundreds
of trees. All of them are small, but the
greater part are already dead, and the rest
are dying. Those nearest the walls are
fullest of leaves, as if the walls somehow
gave them protection. The forest is creeping
into the inclosure. Here and there the
graceful palm-like tassel of a young long-leaved
pine rises above the tall winter-killed
grass. It is not the worst thing about the
world that it tends to run wild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">« 118 »</a></span></p>

<p>Now the quail sings again, this time in
two notes, and now the hummer is again in
the orange-tree. And all the while the redbird
whistles in the shrubbery. He feels
the beauty of the day. If I were a bird, I
would sing with him. From far away comes
the chant of a pine-wood sparrow. I can
just hear it.</p>

<p>This is a place for dreams and quietness.
Nothing else seems worth the having. Let
us feel no more the fever of life. Surely
they are the wise who seek Nirvana; who
insist not upon themselves, but wait absorption&mdash;reabsorption&mdash;into
the infinite.
The dead have the better part. I think of
the stirring, adventurous man who built
these walls and dug these canals. His life
was full of action, full of journeyings and
fightings. Now he is at peace, and his
works do follow him&mdash;into the land of forgetfulness.
Blessed are the dead. Blessed,
too, are the bees, the birds, the butterflies,
and the lizards. Next to the dead, perhaps,
they are happy. And I also am happy, for
I too am under the spell. To me also the
sun and the air are sweet, and I too, for to-day
at least, am careless of the world and
all its doings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">« 119 »</a></span></p>

<p>So I sat dreaming, when suddenly there
was a stir in the grass at my feet. A snake
was coming straight toward me. Only the
evening before a cracker had filled my ears
with stories of &ldquo;rattlers&rdquo; and &ldquo;moccasins.&rdquo;
He seemed to have seen them everywhere,
and to have killed them as one kills mosquitoes.
I looked a second time at the moving
thing in the grass. It was clothed in innocent
black; but, being a son of Adam, I
rose with involuntary politeness to let it
pass. An instant more, and it slipped into
the masonry at my side, and I sat down
again. It had been out taking the sun, and
had come back to its hole in the wall. How
like the story of my own day,&mdash;of my
whole winter vacation! Nay, if we choose
to view it so, how like the story of human
life itself!</p>

<p>As I started homeward, leaving the mill
and the cabin behind me, some cattle were
feeding in the grassy road. At sight of my
umbrella (there are few places where a
sunshade is more welcome than in a Florida
pine-wood) they scampered away into
the scrub. Poor, wild-eyed, hungry-looking
things! I thought of Pharaoh&rsquo;s lean kine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">« 120 »</a></span>
They were like the country itself, I was
ready to say. But perhaps I misjudged
both, seeing both, as I did, in the winter
season. With the mercury at 80°, or thereabout,
it is hard for the Northern tourist
to remember that he is looking at a winter
landscape. He compares a Florida winter
with a New England summer, and can
hardly find words to tell you how barren
and poverty-stricken the country looks.</p>

<p>After this I went more than once to the
sugar mill. Morning and afternoon I visited
it, but somehow I could never renew
the joy of my first visit. Moods are not
to be had for the asking, nor earned by a
walk. The place was still interesting, the
birds were there, the sunshine was pleasant,
and the sea breeze fanned me. The orange
blossoms were still sweet, and the bees still
hummed about them; but it was another
day, or I was another man. In memory,
none the less, all my visits blend in one,
and the ruined mill in the dying orchard remains
one of the bright spots in that strange
Southern world which, almost from the moment
I left it behind me, began to fade into
indistinctness, like the landscape of a dream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> city of Sanford is a beautiful and
interesting place, I hope, to those who live
in it. To the Florida tourist it is important
as lying at the head of steamboat navigation
on the St. John&rsquo;s River, which here expands
into a lake&mdash;Lake Monroe&mdash;some five
miles in width, with Sanford on one side,
and Enterprise on the other; or, as a waggish
traveler once expressed it, with Enterprise
on the north, and Sanford and enterprise
on the south.</p>

<p>Walking naturalists and lovers of things
natural have their own point of view, individual,
unconventional, whimsical, if you
please,&mdash;very different, at all events, from
that of clearer-witted and more serious-minded
men; and the inhabitants of Sanford
will doubtless take it as a compliment,
and be amused rather than annoyed, when I
confess that I found their city a discouragement,
a widespread desolation of houses and
shops. If there is a pleasant country road
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">« 122 »</a></span>
leading out of it in any direction, I was
unlucky enough to miss it. My melancholy
condition was hit off before my eyes in a
parable, as it were, by a crowd of young
fellows, black and white, whom I found one
afternoon in a sand-lot just outside the city,
engaged in what was intended for a game
of baseball. They were doing their best,&mdash;certainly
they made noise enough; but circumstances
were against them. When the
ball came to the ground, from no matter
what height or with what impetus, it fell
dead in the sand; if it had been made of
solid rubber, it could not have rebounded.
&ldquo;Base-running&rdquo; was little better than base-walking.
&ldquo;Sliding&rdquo; was safe, but, by the
same token, impossible. Worse yet, at
every &ldquo;foul strike&rdquo; or &ldquo;wild throw&rdquo; the
ball was lost, and the barefooted fielders
had to pick their way painfully about in the
outlying saw-palmetto scrub till they found
it. I had never seen our &ldquo;national game&rdquo;
played under conditions so untoward. None
but true patriots would have the heart to try
it, I thought, and I meditated writing to
Washington, where the quadrennial purification
of the civil service was just then in progress,&mdash;under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">« 123 »</a></span>
a new broom,&mdash;to secure, if
possible, a few bits of recognition (&ldquo;plums&rdquo;
is the technical term, I believe) for men so
deserving. The first baseman certainly,
who had oftenest to wade into the scrub,
should have received a consulate, at the very
least. Yet they were a merry crew, those
national gamesters. Their patriotism was of
the noblest type,&mdash;the unconscious. They
had no thought of being heroes, nor dreamed
of bounties or pensions. They quarreled
with the umpire, of course, but not with
Fate; and I hope I profited by their example.
My errand in Sanford was to see
something of the river in its narrower and
better part; and having done that, I did not
regret what otherwise might have seemed a
profitless week.</p>

<p>First, however, I walked about the city.
Here, as already at St. Augustine, and afterward
at Tallahassee, I found the mocking-birds
in free song. They are birds of the
town. And the same is true of the loggerhead
shrikes, a pair of which had built a
nest in a small water-oak at the edge of the
sidewalk, on a street corner, just beyond the
reach of passers-by. In the roadside trees&mdash;all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">« 124 »</a></span>
freshly planted, like the city&mdash;were
myrtle warblers, prairie warblers, and blue
yellow-backs, the two latter in song. Once,
after a shower, I watched a myrtle bird
bathing on a branch among the wet leaves.
The street gutters were running with sulphur
water, but he had waited for rain. I commended
his taste, being myself one of those to
whom water and brimstone is a combination
as malodorous as it seems unscriptural.
Noisy boat-tailed grackles, or &ldquo;jackdaws,&rdquo;
were plentiful about the lakeside, monstrously
long in the tail, and almost as
large as the fish crows, which were often
there with them. Over the broad lake
swept purple martins and white-breasted
swallows, and nearer the shore fed peacefully
a few pied-billed grebes, or dabchicks,
birds that I had seen only two or three
times before, and at which I looked more
than once before I made out what they
were. They had every appearance of passing
a winter of content. At the tops of
three or four stakes, which stood above the
water at wide intervals,&mdash;and at long distances
from the shore,&mdash;sat commonly as
many cormorants, here, as everywhere, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">« 125 »</a></span>
plenty of idle time upon their hands. On
the other side of the city were orange groves,
large, well kept, thrifty-looking; the fruit
still on the trees (March 20, or thereabouts),
or lying in heaps underneath, ready for the
boxes. One man&rsquo;s house, I remember, was
surrounded by a fence overrun with Cherokee
rosebushes, a full quarter of a mile of
white blossoms.</p>

<p>My best botanical stroll was along one of
the railroads (Sanford is a &ldquo;railway centre,&rdquo;
so called), through a dreary sand
waste. Here I picked a goodly number of
novelties, including what looked like a
beautiful pink chicory, only the plant itself
was much prettier (<i>Lygodesmia</i>); a very
curious sensitive-leaved plant (<i>Schrankia</i>),
densely beset throughout with curved
prickles, and bearing globes of tiny pink-purple
flowers; a calopogon, quite as pretty
as our Northern <i>pulchellus</i>; a clematis
(<i>Baldwinii</i>), which looked more like a
bluebell than a clematis till I commenced
pulling it to pieces; and a great profusion
of one of the smaller papaws, or custard-apples,
a low shrub, just then full of large,
odd-shaped, creamy-white, heavy-scented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">« 126 »</a></span>
blossoms. I was carrying a sprig of it in
my hand when I met a negro. &ldquo;What is
this?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I dunno, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
it papaw?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir, that ain&rsquo;t papaw;&rdquo;
and then, as if he had just remembered
something, he added, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s dog banana.&rdquo;
Oftener than anywhere else I resorted to
the shore of the lake,&mdash;to the one small
part of it, that is to say, which was at the
same time easily reached and comparatively
unfrequented. There&mdash;going one day farther
than usual&mdash;I found myself in the
borderland of a cypress swamp. On one
side was the lake, but between me and it
were cypress-trees; and on the other side
was the swamp itself, a dense wood growing
in stagnant black water covered here and
there with duckweed or some similar growth:
a frightful place it seemed, the very abode
of snakes and everything evil. Stories of
slaves hiding in cypress swamps came into
my mind. It must have been cruel treatment
that drove them to it! Buzzards flew
about my head, and looked at me. &ldquo;He
has come here to die,&rdquo; I imagined them saying
among themselves. "No one comes
here for anything else. Wait a little, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">« 127 »</a></span>
we will pick his bones." They perched
near by, and, not to lose time, employed the
interval in drying their wings, for the night
had been showery. Once in a while one of
them shifted his perch with an ominous
rustle. They were waiting for me, and
were becoming impatient. &ldquo;He is long
about it,&rdquo; one said to another; and I did
not wonder. The place seemed one from
which none who entered it could ever go
out; and there was no going farther in
without plunging into that horrible mire.
I stood still, and looked and listened. Some
strange noise, &ldquo;bird or devil,&rdquo; came from
the depths of the wood. A flock of grackles
settled in a tall cypress, and for a time
made the place loud. How still it was after
they were gone! I could hardly withdraw
my gaze from the green water full of slimy
black roots and branches, any one of which
might suddenly lift its head and open its
deadly white mouth! Once a fish-hawk fell
to screaming farther down the lake. I had
seen him the day before, standing on the
rim of his huge nest in the top of a tree,
and uttering the same cries. All about
me gigantic cypresses, every one swollen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">« 128 »</a></span>
enormously at the base, rose straight and
branchless into the air. Dead trees, one
might have said,&mdash;light-colored, apparently
with no bark to cover them; but if I
glanced up, I saw that each bore at the top
a scanty head of branches just now putting
forth fresh green leaves, while long funereal
streamers of dark Spanish moss hung thickly
from every bough.</p>

<p>I am not sure how long I could have
stayed in such a spot, if I had not been able
to look now and then through the branches
of the under-woods out upon the sunny lake.
Swallows innumerable were playing over
the water, many of them soaring so high as
to be all but invisible. Wise and happy
birds, lovers of sunlight and air. <i>They</i>
would never be found in a cypress swamp.
Along the shore, in a weedy shallow, the
peaceful dabchicks were feeding. Far off
on a post toward the middle of the lake
stood a cormorant. But I could not keep
my eyes long at once in that direction. The
dismal swamp had me under its spell, and
meanwhile the patient buzzards looked at
me. &ldquo;It is almost time,&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;the
fever will do its work,&rdquo;&mdash;and I began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">« 129 »</a></span>
believe it. It was too bad to come away;
the stupid town offered no attraction; but it
seemed perilous to remain. Perhaps I <i>could</i>
not come away. I would try it and see. It
was amazing that I could; and no sooner
was I out in the sunshine than I wished I
had stayed where I was; for having once
left the place, I was never likely to find it
again. The way was plain enough, to be
sure, and my feet would no doubt serve
me. But the feet cannot do the mind&rsquo;s part,
and it is a sad fact, one of the saddest in
life, that sensations cannot be repeated.</p>

<p>With the fascination of the swamp still
upon me, I heard somewhere in the distance
a musical voice, and soon came in sight of a
garden where a middle-aged negro was hoeing,&mdash;hoeing
and singing: a wild, minor,
endless kind of tune; a hymn, as seemed
likely from a word caught here and there;
a true piece of natural melody, as artless as
any bird&rsquo;s. I walked slowly to get more
of it, and the happy-sad singer minded me
not, but kept on with his hoe and his song.
Potatoes or corn, whatever his crop may have
been,&mdash;I did not notice, or, if I did, I have
forgotten,&mdash;it should have prospered under
his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">« 130 »</a></span></p>

<p>Farther along, in the highway,&mdash;a sandy
track, with wastes of scrub on either side,&mdash;a
boy of eight or nine, armed with a double-barreled
gun, was lingering about a patch
of dwarf oaks and palmettos. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
got that rabbit yet, eh?&rdquo; said I. (I had
passed him there on my way out, and he
had told me what he was after.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s any rabbit there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is, sir; I saw one a little
while ago, but he got away before I could
get pretty near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;Here is a grammarian.
Not one boy in ten in this country
but would have said &lsquo;I seen.&rsquo;&rdquo; A scholar
like this was worth talking with. &ldquo;Are
there many rabbits here?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, there&rsquo;s a good deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so, by easy mental stages, I was
clear of the swamp and back in the town,&mdash;saved
from the horrible, and delivered
to the commonplace and the dreary.</p>

<p>My best days in Sanford were two that I
spent on the river above the lake. A youthful
boatman, expert alike with the oar and
the gun, served me faithfully and well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">« 131 »</a></span>
impossible as it was for him to enter fully
into the spirit of a man who wanted to look
at birds, but not to kill them. I think he
had never before seen a customer of that
breed. First he rowed me up the &ldquo;creek,&rdquo;
under promise to show me alligators, moccasins,
and no lack of birds, including the
especially desired purple gallinule. The
snakes were somehow missing (a loss not
irreparable), and so were the purple gallinules;
for them, the boy thought, it was
still rather early in the season, although he
had killed one a few days before, and for
proof had brought me a wing. But as we
were skirting along the shore I suddenly
called &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; An alligator lay on the
bank just before us. The boy turned his
head, and instantly was all excitement. It
was a big fellow, he said,&mdash;one of three
big ones that inhabited the creek. He would
get him this time. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; I
asked. &ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;ll blow the top of his
head off.&rdquo; He was loaded for gallinules,
and I, being no sportsman, and never having
seen an alligator before, was some
shades less confident. But it was his game,
and I left him to his way. He pulled the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">« 132 »</a></span>
boat noiselessly against the bank in the
shelter of tall reeds, put down the oars, with
which he could almost have touched the
alligator, and took up his gun. At that
moment the creature got wind of us, and
slipped incontinently into the water, not a
little to my relief. One live alligator is
worth a dozen dead ones, to my thinking.
He showed his back above the surface of the
stream for a moment shortly afterward, and
then disappeared for good.</p>

<p>Ornithologically, the creek was a disappointment.
We pushed into one bay after
another, among the dense &ldquo;bonnets,&rdquo;&mdash;huge
leaves of the common yellow pond lily,&mdash;but
found nothing that I had not seen
before. Here and there a Florida gallinule
put up its head among the leaves, or took
flight as we pressed too closely upon it; but
I saw them to no advantage, and with a
single exception they were dumb. One bird,
as it dashed into the rushes, uttered two
or three cries that sounded familiar. The
Florida gallinule is in general pretty silent,
I think; but he has a noisy season; then he
is indeed noisy enough. A swamp containing
a single pair might be supposed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">« 133 »</a></span>
populous with barn-yard fowls, the fellow
keeps up such a clatter: now loud and terror-stricken,
&ldquo;like a hen whose head is just going
to be cut off,&rdquo; as a friend once expressed
it; then soft and full of content, as if the
aforesaid hen had laid an egg ten minutes
before, and were still felicitating herself
upon the achievement. It was vexatious
that here, in the very home of Florida gallinules,
I should see and hear less of them
than I had more than once done in Massachusetts,
where they are esteemed a pretty
choice rarity, and where, in spite of what
I suppose must be called exceptional good
luck, my acquaintance with them had been
limited to perhaps half a dozen birds. But
in affairs of this kind a direct chase is
seldom the best rewarded. At one point
the boatman pulled up to a thicket of small
willows, bidding me be prepared to see birds
in enormous numbers; but we found only a
small company of night herons&mdash;evidently
breeding there&mdash;and a green heron. The
latter my boy shot before I knew what he
was doing. He took my reproof in good
part, protesting that he had had only a
glimpse of the bird, and had taken it for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">« 134 »</a></span>
possible gallinule. In the course of the trip
we saw, besides the species already named,
great blue and little blue herons, pied-billed
grebes, coots, cormorants, a flock of small
sandpipers (on the wing), buzzards, vultures,
fish-hawks, and innumerable red-winged
blackbirds.</p>

<p>Three days afterward we went up the
river. At the upper end of the lake were
many white-billed coots (<i>Fulica americana</i>);
so many that we did our best to
count them as they rose, flock after flock,
dragging their feet over the water behind
them with a multitudinous splashing noise.
There were a thousand, at least. They had
an air of being not so very shy, but they
were nobody&rsquo;s fools. &ldquo;See there!&rdquo; my boy
would exclaim, as a hundred or two of them
dashed past the boat; &ldquo;see how they keep
just out of range!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were hardly on the river itself before
he fell into a state of something like frenzy
at the sight of an otter swimming before us,
showing its head, and then diving. He
made after it in hot haste, and fired I know
not how many times, but all for nothing.
He had killed several before now, he said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">« 135 »</a></span>
but had never been obliged to chase one in
this fashion. Perhaps there was a Jonah in
the ship; for though I sympathized with the
boy, I sympathized also, and still more
warmly, with the otter. It acted as if life
were dear to it, and for aught I knew it had
as good a right to live as either the boy or I.
No such qualms disturbed me a few minutes
later, when, as the boat was grazing the
reeds, I espied just ahead a snake lying in
wait among them. I gave the alarm, and
the boy looked round. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a
big one, a moccasin,&mdash;a cotton-mouth; but
I&rsquo;ll fix him.&rdquo; He pulled a stroke or two
nearer, then lifted his oar and brought it
down splash; but the reeds broke the blow,
and the moccasin slipped into the water,
apparently unharmed. That was a case for
powder and shot. Florida people have a
poor opinion of a man who meets a venomous
snake, no matter where, without doing
his best to kill it. How strong the feeling
is my boatman gave me proof within ten minutes
after his failure with the cotton-mouth.
He had pulled out into the middle of the
river, when I noticed a beautiful snake, short
and rather stout, lying coiled on the water.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">« 136 »</a></span>
Whether it was an optical illusion I cannot
say, but it seemed to me that the creature
lay entirely above the surface,&mdash;as if it had
been an inflated skin rather than a live
snake. We passed close by it, but it made
no offer to move, only darting out its tongue
as the boat slipped past. I spoke to the
boy, who at once ceased rowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I must go back and kill that
fellow,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; I asked, with surprise, for I
had looked upon it simply as a curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t like to see it live. It&rsquo;s the
poisonousest snake there is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke he turned the boat: but the
snake saved him further trouble, for just
then it uncoiled and swam directly toward
us, as if it meant to come aboard. &ldquo;Oh,
you&rsquo;re coming this way, are you?&rdquo; said the
boy sarcastically. &ldquo;Well, come on!&rdquo; The
snake came on, and when it got well within
range he took up his fishing-rod (with hooks
at the end for drawing game out of the
reeds and bonnets), and the next moment
the snake lay dead upon the water. He
slipped the end of the pole under it and
slung it ashore. "There! how do you like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">« 137 »</a></span>
that?" said he, and he headed the boat
upstream again. It was a &ldquo;copper-bellied
moccasin,&rdquo; he declared, whatever that may
be, and was worse than a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>On the river, as in the creek, we were
continually exploring bays and inlets, each
with its promising patch of bonnets. Nearly
every such place contained at least one
Florida gallinule; but where were the &ldquo;purples,&rdquo;
about which we kept talking,&mdash;the
&ldquo;royal purples,&rdquo; concerning whose beauty
my boy was so eloquent?</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not common yet,&rdquo; he would
say. &ldquo;By and by they will be as thick
as Floridas are now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t they stay here all winter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; not the purples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, sir. I have hunted this river
too much. They couldn&rsquo;t be here in the
winter without my knowing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wondered whether he could be right, or
partly right, notwithstanding the book statements
to the contrary. I notice that Mr.
Chapman, writing of his experiences with
this bird at Gainesville, says, "None were
seen until May 25, when, in a part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">« 138 »</a></span>
lake before unvisited,&mdash;a mass of floating
islands and &lsquo;bonnets,&rsquo;&mdash;I found them not
uncommon." The boy&rsquo;s assertions may be
worth recording, at any rate.</p>

<p>In one place he fired suddenly, and as he
put down the gun he exclaimed, &ldquo;There!
I&rsquo;ll bet I&rsquo;ve shot a bird you never saw
before. It had a bill as long as that,&rdquo;
with one finger laid crosswise upon another.
He hauled the prize into the boat, and sure
enough, it was a novelty,&mdash;a king rail, new
to both of us. We had gone a little farther,
and were passing a prairie, on which were
pools of water where the boy said he had
often seen large flocks of white ibises feeding
(there were none there now, alas, though we
crept up with all cautiousness to peep over
the bank), when all at once I descried some
sharp-winged, strange-looking bird over our
heads. It showed sidewise at the moment,
but an instant later it turned, and I saw its
long forked tail, and almost in the same
breath its white head. A fork-tailed kite!
and purple gallinules were for the time forgotten.
It was performing the most graceful
evolutions, swooping half-way to the
earth from a great height, and then sweeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">« 139 »</a></span>
upward again. Another minute, and I
saw a second bird, farther away. I watched
the nearer one till it faded from sight, soaring
and swooping by turns,&mdash;its long, scissors-shaped
tail all the while fully spread,&mdash;but
never coming down, as its habit is said
to be, to skim over the surface of the water.
There is nothing more beautiful on wings,
I believe: a large hawk, with a swallow&rsquo;s
grace of form, color, and motion. I saw it
once more (four birds) over the St. Mark&rsquo;s
River, and counted the sight one of the chief
rewards of my Southern winter.</p>

<p>At noon we rested and ate our luncheon
in the shade of three or four tall palmetto-trees
standing by themselves on a broad
prairie, a place brightened by beds of blue
iris and stretches of golden senecio,&mdash;homelike
as well as pretty, both of them. Then
we set out again. The day was intensely
hot (March 24), and my oarsman was more
than half sick with a sudden cold. I begged
him to take things easily, but he soon experienced
an almost miraculous renewal of
his forces. In one of the first of our after-dinner
bonnet patches, he seized his gun,
fired, and began to shout, &ldquo;A purple! a purple!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">« 140 »</a></span>
He drew the bird in, as proud as
a prince. &ldquo;There, sir!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
I tell you it was handsome? It has every
color there is.&rdquo; And indeed it was handsome,
worthy to be called the &ldquo;Sultana;&rdquo;
with the most exquisite iridescent bluish-purple
plumage, the legs yellow, or greenish-yellow
(a point by which it may be distinguished
from the Florida gallinule, as the
bird flies from you), the bill red tipped with
pale green, and the shield (on the forehead,
like a continuation of the upper mandible)
light blue, of a peculiar shade, &ldquo;just as if it
had been painted.&rdquo; From that moment the
boy was a new creature. Again and again
he spoke of his altered feelings. He could
pull the boat now anywhere I wanted to go.
He was perfectly fresh, he declared, although
I thought he had already done a
pretty good day&rsquo;s work under that scorching
sun. I had not imagined how deeply his
heart was set upon showing me the bird
I was after. It made me twice as glad to
see it, dead though it was.</p>

<p>Within an hour, on our way homeward,
we came upon another. It sprang out of
the lily pads, and sped toward the tall grass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">« 141 »</a></span>
of the shore. &ldquo;Look! look! a purple!&rdquo;
the boy cried. &ldquo;See his yellow legs!&rdquo;
Instinctively he raised his gun, but I said
No. It would be inexcusable to shoot a
second one; and besides, we were at that
moment approaching a bird about which I
felt a stronger curiosity,&mdash;a snake-bird, or
water-turkey, sitting in a willow shrub at
the further end of the bay. &ldquo;Pull me as
near it as it will let us come,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I
want to see as much of it as possible.&rdquo; At
every rod or two I stopped the boat and put
up my glasses, till we were within perhaps
sixty feet of the bird. Then it took wing,
but instead of flying away went sweeping
about us. On getting round to the willows
again it made as if it would alight, uttering
at the same time some faint ejaculations,
like &ldquo;ah! ah! ah!&rdquo; but it kept on for a
second sweep of the circle. Then it perched
in its old place, but faced us a little less
directly, so that I could see the beautiful
silver tracery of its wings, like the finest
of embroidery, as I thought. After we had
eyed it for some minutes we suddenly perceived
a second bird, ten feet or so from it,
in full sight. Where it came from, or how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">« 142 »</a></span>
it got there, I have no idea. Our first bird
kept his bill parted, as if in distress; a
peculiar action, which probably had some
connection with the other bird&rsquo;s presence,
although the two paid no attention to each
other so far as we could make out. When
we had watched them as long as we pleased,
I told the boy to pull the boat forward till
they rose. We got within thirty feet, I
think. At that point they took flight, and,
side by side, went soaring into the air, now
flapping their wings, now scaling in unison.
It was beautiful to see. As they sat in the
willows and gazed about, their long necks
were sometimes twisted like corkscrews,&mdash;or
so they looked, at all events.</p>

<p>The water-turkey is one of the very oddest
of birds. I am not likely to forget the
impression made upon me by the first one
I saw. It was standing on a prostrate log,
but rose, as I drew near, and, to my surprise,
mounted to a prodigious elevation, where
for a long time it remained, sailing round
and round with all the grace of a hen-hawk
or an eagle. Its neck and head were tenuous
almost beyond belief,&mdash;like a knitting-needle,
I kept repeating to myself. Its tail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">« 143 »</a></span>
too, shaped like a narrow wedge, was unconscionably
long; and as the bird showed
against the sky, I could think of nothing
but an animated sign of addition. A better
man&mdash;the Emperor Constantine, shall
we say?&mdash;might have seen in it a nobler
symbol.</p>

<p>While we were loitering down the river,
later in the afternoon, an eagle made its appearance
far overhead, the first one of the
day. The boy, for some reason, refused to
believe that it was an eagle. Nothing but a
sight of its white head and tail through the
glass could convince him. (The perfectly
square <i>set</i> of the wings as the bird sails is a
pretty strong mark, at no matter what distance.)
Presently an osprey, not far from
us, with a fish in his claws, set up a violent
screaming. &ldquo;It is because he has caught a
fish,&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;he is calling his mate.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is because the eagle is
after him. Wait a bit.&rdquo; In fact, the eagle
was already in pursuit, and the hawk, as he
always does, had begun struggling upward
with all his might. That is the fish-hawk&rsquo;s
way of appealing to Heaven against his oppressor.
He was safe for that time. Three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">« 144 »</a></span>
negroes, shad-fishers, were just beyond us
(we had seen them there in the morning,
wading about the river setting their nets),
and at the sight of them and of us, I have
no doubt, the eagle turned away. The boy
was not peculiar in his notion about the osprey&rsquo;s
scream. Some one else had told me
that the bird always screamed after catching
a fish. But I knew better, having seen
him catch a hundred, more or less, without
uttering a sound. The safe rule, in such
cases, is to listen to all you hear, and believe
it&mdash;after you have verified it for
yourself.</p>

<p>It was while we were discussing this question,
I think, that the boy opened his heart
to me about my methods of study. He had
looked through the glass now and then, and
of course had been astonished at its power.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;I never had any
idea it could be so much fun just to look at
birds in the way you do!&rdquo; I liked the turn
of his phrase. It seemed to say, &ldquo;Yes, I begin
to see through it. We are in the same
boat. This that you call study is only another
kind of sport.&rdquo; I could have shaken
hands with him but that he had the oars.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">« 145 »</a></span>
Who does not love to be flattered by an
ingenuous boy?</p>

<p>All in all, the day had been one to be remembered.
In addition to the birds already
named&mdash;three of them new to me&mdash;we had
seen great blue herons, little blue herons,
Louisiana herons, night herons, cormorants,
pied-billed grebes, kingfishers, red-winged
blackbirds, boat-tailed grackles, redpoll and
myrtle warblers, savanna sparrows, tree
swallows, purple martins, a few meadow
larks, and the ubiquitous turkey buzzard.
The boat-tails abounded along the river
banks, and, with their tameness and their
ridiculous outcries, kept us amused whenever
there was nothing else to absorb our attention.
The prairie lands through which the
river meanders proved to be surprisingly
dry and passable (the water being unusually
low, the boy said), with many cattle pastured
upon them. Here we found the savanna
sparrows; here, too, the meadow larks
were singing.</p>

<p>It was a hard pull across the rough lake
against the wind (a dangerous sheet of
water for flat-bottomed rowboats, I was told
afterward), but the boy was equal to it, protesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">« 146 »</a></span>
that he didn&rsquo;t feel tired a bit, now
we had got the &ldquo;purples;&rdquo; and if he did not
catch the fever from drinking some quarts
of river water (a big bottle of coffee having
proved to be only a drop in the bucket),
against my urgent remonstrances and his
own judgment, I am sure he looks back
upon the labor as on the whole well spent.
He was going North in the spring, he told
me. May joy be with him wherever he is!</p>

<p>The next morning I took the steamer
down the river to Blue Spring, a distance of
some thirty miles, on my way back to New
Smyrna, to a place where there were accessible
woods, a beach, and, not least, a daily sea
breeze. The river in that part of its course
is comfortably narrow,&mdash;a great advantage,&mdash;winding
through cypress swamps, hammock
woods, stretches of prairie, and in one
place a pine barren; an interesting and
in many ways beautiful country, but so
unwholesome looking as to lose much of
its attractiveness. Three or four large alligators
lay sunning themselves in the most
obliging manner upon the banks, here one
and there one, to the vociferous delight of
the passengers, who ran from one side of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">« 147 »</a></span>
deck to the other, as the captain shouted
and pointed. One, he told us, was thirteen
feet long, the largest in the river. Each
appeared to have its own well-worn sunning-spot,
and all, I believe, kept their places, as
if the passing of the big steamer&mdash;almost
too big for the river at some of the sharper
turns&mdash;had come to seem a commonplace
event. Herons in the usual variety were
present, with ospreys, an eagle, kingfishers,
ground doves, Carolina doves, blackbirds
(red-wings and boat-tails), tree swallows,
purple martins, and a single wild turkey, the
first one I had ever seen. It was near the
bank of the river, on a bushy prairie, fully
exposed, and crouched as the steamer passed.
For a Massachusetts ornithologist the mere
sight of such a bird was enough to make a
pretty good Thanksgiving Day. Blue yellow-backed
warblers were singing here and
there, and I retain a particular remembrance
of one bluebird that warbled to us from the
pine-woods. The captain told me, somewhat
to my surprise, that he had seen two
flocks of paroquets during the winter (they
had been very abundant along the river
within his time, he said), but for me there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">« 148 »</a></span>
was no such fortune. One bird, soaring in
company with a buzzard at a most extraordinary
height straight over the river, greatly
excited my curiosity. The captain declared
that it must be a great blue heron; but he
had never seen one thus engaged, nor, so far
as I can learn, has any one else ever done so.
Its upper parts seemed to be mostly white,
and I can only surmise that it may have
been a sand-hill crane, a bird which is said
to have such a habit.</p>

<p>As I left the boat I had a little experience
of the seamy side of Southern travel; nothing
to be angry about, perhaps, but annoying,
nevertheless, on a hot day. I surrendered
my check to the purser of the boat,
and the deck hands put my trunk upon the
landing at Blue Spring. But there was no
one there to receive it, and the station was
locked. We had missed the noon train, with
which we were advertised to connect, by so
many hours that I had ceased to think about
it. Finally, a negro, one of several who
were fishing thereabouts, advised me to go
&ldquo;up to the house,&rdquo; which he pointed out behind
some woods, and see the agent. This
I did, and the agent, in turn, advised me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">« 149 »</a></span>
walk up the track to the &ldquo;Junction,&rdquo; and
be sure to tell the conductor, when the evening
train arrived, as it probably would do
some hours later, that I had a trunk at the
landing. Otherwise the train would not run
down to the river, and my baggage would lie
there till Monday. He would go down presently
and put it under cover. Happily, he
fulfilled his promise, for it was already beginning
to thunder, and soon it rained in
torrents, with a cold wind that made the hot
weather all at once a thing of the past.</p>

<p>It was a long wait in the dreary little
station; or rather it would have been, had
not the tedium of it been relieved by the
presence of a newly married couple, whose
honeymoon was just then at the full. Their
delight in each other was exuberant, effervescent,
beatific,&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;quite
beyond veiling or restraint. At first I bestowed
upon them sidewise and cornerwise
glances only, hiding bashfully behind my
spectacles, as it were, and pretending to see
nothing; but I soon perceived that I was to
them of no more consequence than a fly on
the wall. If they saw me, which sometimes
seemed doubtful,&mdash;for love is blind,&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">« 150 »</a></span>
evidently thought me too sensible, or too old,
to mind a little billing and cooing. And
they were right in their opinion. What was
I in Florida for, if not for the study of natural
history? And truly, I have seldom
seen, even among birds, a pair less sophisticated,
less cabined and confined by that disastrous
knowledge of good and evil which is
commonly understood to have resulted from
the eating of forbidden fruit, and which
among prudish people goes by the name of
modesty. It was refreshing. Charles
Lamb himself would have enjoyed it, and, I
should hope, would have added some qualifying
footnotes to a certain unamiable essay
of his concerning the behavior of married
people.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="ON_THE_ST_AUGUSTINE_ROAD" id="ON_THE_ST_AUGUSTINE_ROAD">ON THE ST. AUGUSTINE ROAD.</a></p>


<p>One of my first inquiries at Tallahassee
was for the easiest way to the woods. The
city is built on a hill, with other hills about
it. These are mostly under cultivation, and
such woods as lay within sight seemed to
be pretty far off; and with the mercury at
ninety in the shade, long tramps were almost
out of the question. &ldquo;Take the St. Augustine
road,&rdquo; said the man to whom I had
spoken; and he pointed out its beginning
nearly opposite the state capitol. After
breakfast I followed his advice, with results
so pleasing that I found myself turning
that corner again and again as long as I
remained in Tallahassee.</p>

<p>The road goes abruptly downhill to the
railway track, first between deep red gulches,
and then between rows of negro cabins, each
with its garden of rosebushes, now (early
April) in full bloom. The deep sides of
the gulches were draped with pendent lantana
branches full of purple flowers, or,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">« 152 »</a></span>
more beautiful still, with a profusion of
fragrant white honeysuckle. On the roadside,
between the wheel-track and the gulch,
grew brilliant Mexican poppies, with Venus&rsquo;s
looking-glass, yellow oxalis, and beds
of blackberry vines. The woods of which
my informant had spoken lay a little beyond
the railway, on the right hand of the road,
just as it began another ascent. I entered
them at once, and after a semicircular turn
through the pleasant paths, amid live-oaks,
water-oaks, red oaks, chestnut oaks, magnolias,
beeches, hickories, hornbeams, sweet
gums, sweet bays, and long-leaved and
short-leaved pines, came out into the road
again a quarter of a mile farther up
the hill. They were the fairest of woods
to stroll in, it seemed to me, with paths
enough, and not too many, and good
enough, but not too good; that is to say,
they were footpaths, not roads, though
afterwards, on a Sunday afternoon, I met
two young fellows riding through them on
bicycles. The wood was delightful, also,
after my two months in eastern Florida, for
lying on a slope, and for having an undergrowth
of loose shrubbery instead of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">« 153 »</a></span>
jungle of scrub oak and saw palmetto. Blue
jays and crested flycatchers were doing
their best to outscream one another,&mdash;with
the odds in favor of the flycatchers,&mdash;and
a few smaller birds were singing, especially
two or three summer tanagers, as many
yellow-throated warblers, and a ruby-crowned
kinglet. In one part of the wood, near
what I took to be an old city reservoir, I
came upon a single white-throated sparrow
and a humming-bird,&mdash;the latter a strangely
uncommon sight in Tallahassee, where, of
all the places I have ever seen, it ought to
find itself in clover. Here, too, were a pair
of Carolina wrens, just now in search of
a building-site, and conducting themselves
exactly in the manner of bluebirds intent
on such business; peeping into every hole
that offered itself, and then, after the briefest
interchange of opinion,&mdash;unfavorable
on the female&rsquo;s part, if we may guess,&mdash;concluding
to look a little farther.</p>

<p>As I struck the road again, a man came
along on horseback, and we fell into conversation
about the country. &ldquo;A lovely country,&rdquo;
he called it, and I agreed with him.
He inquired where I was from, and I mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">« 154 »</a></span>
that I had lately been in southern
Florida, and found this region a strong
contrast. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he returned; and, pointing
to the grass, he remarked upon the
richness of the soil. &ldquo;This yere land would
fertilize that,&rdquo; he said, speaking of southern
Florida. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said I. I
meant to be understood as concurring in his
opinion, but such a qualified, Yankeefied
assent seemed to him no assent at all. &ldquo;Oh,
it will, it will!&rdquo; he responded, as if the
point were one about which I must on no
account be left unconvinced. He told me
that the fine house at which I had looked, a
little distance back, through a long vista of
trees, was the residence of Captain H., who
owned all the land along the road for a
good distance. I inquired how far the road
was pretty, like this. &ldquo;For forty miles,&rdquo; he
said. That was farther than I was ready to
walk, and coming soon to the top of the hill,
or, more exactly, of the plateau, I stopped
in the shade of a china-tree, and looked at
the pleasing prospect. Behind me was a
plantation of young pear-trees, and before
me, among the hills northward, lay broad,
cultivated slopes, dotted here and there with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">« 155 »</a></span>
cabins and tall, solitary trees. On the
nearer slope, perhaps a sixteenth of a mile
away, a negro was ploughing, with a single
ox harnessed in some primitive manner,&mdash;with
pieces of wood, for the most part, as
well as I could make out through an opera-glass.
The soil offered the least possible
hindrance, and both he and the ox seemed
to be having a literal &ldquo;walk-over.&rdquo; Beyond
him&mdash;a full half-mile away, perhaps&mdash;another
man was ploughing with a mule; and
in another direction a third was doing likewise,
with a woman following in his wake.
A colored boy of seventeen&mdash;I guessed his
age at twenty-three&mdash;came up the road in a
cart, and I stopped him to inquire about the
crops and other matters. The land in front
of me was planted with cotton, he said; and
the men ploughing in the distance were getting
ready to plant the same. They hired
the land and the cabins of Captain H., paying
him so much cotton (not so much an
acre, but so much a mule, if I understood
him rightly) by way of rent. We talked a
long time about one thing and another. He
had been south as far as the Indian River
country, but was glad to be back again in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">« 156 »</a></span>
Tallahassee, where he was born. I asked
him about the road, how far it went. &ldquo;They
tell me it goes smack to St. Augustine,&rdquo;
he replied; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t tried it.&rdquo; It was an
unlikely story, it seemed to me, but I was
assured afterward that he was right; that
the road actually runs across the country
from Tallahassee to St. Augustine, a distance
of about two hundred miles. With
company of my own choosing, and in cooler
weather, I thought I should like to walk its
whole length.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> My young man was in no
haste. With the reins (made of rope, after
a fashion much followed in Florida) lying
on the forward axle of his cart, he seemed to
have put himself entirely at my service.
He had to the full that peculiar urbanity
which I began after a while to look upon as
characteristic of Tallahassee negroes,&mdash;a
gentleness of speech, and a kindly, deferential
air, neither forward nor servile, such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">« 157 »</a></span>
sits well on any man, whatever the color of
his skin.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> But let no enthusiast set out to walk from one city to
the other on the strength of what is here written. After
this sketch was first printed&mdash;in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>&mdash;a
gentleman who ought to know whereof he speaks sent
me word that my informants were all of them wrong&mdash;that
the road does not run to St. Augustine. For myself,
I assert nothing. As my colored boy said, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t tried it.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In that respect he was like another boy of
about his own age, who lived in the cabin
directly before us, but whom I did not see
till I had been several times over the road.
Then he happened to be at work near the
edge of the field, and I beckoned him to me.
He, too, was serious and manly in his bearing,
and showed no disposition to go back to
his hoe till I broke off the interview,&mdash;as if
it were a point of good manners with him to
await my pleasure. Yes, the plantation was
a good one and easily cultivated, he said, in
response to some remark of my own. There
were five in the family, and they all worked.
&ldquo;We are all big enough to eat,&rdquo; he added,
quite simply. He had never been North,
but had lately declined the offer of a gentleman
who wished to take him there,&mdash;him
and &ldquo;another fellow.&rdquo; He once went
to Jacksonville, but couldn&rsquo;t stay. &ldquo;You
can get along without your father pretty
well, but it&rsquo;s another thing to do without
your mother.&rdquo; He never meant to leave
home again as long as his mother lived;
which was likely to be for some years, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">« 158 »</a></span>
thought, if she were still able to do her part
in the cotton-field. As a general thing, the
colored tenants of the cabins made out
pretty well, he believed, unless something
happened to the crops. As for the old servants
of the H. family, they didn&rsquo;t have to
work,&mdash;they were provided for; Captain
H.'s father &ldquo;left it so in his testimonial.&rdquo;
I spoke of the purple martins which were
flying back and forth over the field with
many cheerful noises, and of the calabashes
that hung from a tall pole in one corner of
the cabin yard, for their accommodation.
On my way South, I told him, I had noticed
these dangling long-necked squashes everywhere,
and had wondered what they were
for. I had found out since that they were
the colored man&rsquo;s martin-boxes, and was
glad to see the people so fond of the birds.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no danger of
hawks carrying off the chickens as long as
the martins are round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twice afterward, as I went up the road, I
found him ploughing between the cotton-rows;
but he was too far away to be accosted
without shouting, and I did not feel
justified in interrupting him at his work.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">« 159 »</a></span>
Back and forth he went through the long
furrow after the patient ox, the hens and
chickens following. No doubt they thought
the work was all for their benefit. Farther
away, a man and two women were hoeing.
The family deserved to prosper, I said to
myself, as I lay under a big magnolia-tree
(just beginning to open its large white
flowers) and idly enjoyed the scene. And
it was just here, by the bye, that I solved
an interesting etymological puzzle, to wit,
the origin and precise meaning of the word
&ldquo;baygall,&rdquo;&mdash;a word which the visitor often
hears upon the lips of Florida people. An
old hunter in Smyrna, when I questioned
him about it, told me that it meant a swampy
piece of wood, and took its origin, he had
always supposed, from the fact that bay-trees
and gall-bushes commonly grew in
such places. A Tallahassee gentleman
agreed with this explanation, and promised
to bring home some gall-berries the next
time he came across any, that I might see
what they were; but the berries were never
forthcoming, and I was none the wiser, till,
on one of my last trips up the St. Augustine
road, as I stood under the large magnolia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">« 160 »</a></span>
just mentioned, a colored man came along,
hat in hand, and a bag of grain balanced on
his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a large magnolia,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>He assented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about as large as magnolias ever
grow, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; down in the gall there&rsquo;s magnolias
a heap bigger&rsquo;n that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gall? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A baygall, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s a baygall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A big wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why do you call it a baygall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was stumped, it was plain to see. No
doubt he would have scratched his head, if
that useful organ had been accessible. He
hesitated; but it isn&rsquo;t like an uneducated
man to confess ignorance. &ldquo;'Cause it&rsquo;s a
desert,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a thick <i>place</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; I answered, and he resumed
his march.</p>

<p>The road was traveled mostly by negroes.
On Sunday afternoons it looked quite like
a flower garden, it was so full of bright
dresses coming home from church. &ldquo;Now'-days
folks git religion so easy!&rdquo; one young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">« 161 »</a></span>
woman said to another, as they passed me.
She was a conservative. I did not join the
procession, but on other days I talked, first
and last, with a good many of the people;
from the preacher, who carried a handsome
cane and made me a still handsomer bow,
down to a serious little fellow of six or seven
years, whom I found standing at the foot of
the hill, beside a bundle of dead wood. He
was carrying it home for the family stove,
and had set it down for a minute&rsquo;s rest. I
said something about his burden, and as I
went on he called after me: &ldquo;What kind of
birds are you hunting for? Ricebirds?&rdquo; I
answered that I was looking for birds of all
sorts. Had he seen any ricebirds lately?
Yes, he said; he started a flock the other day
up on<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the hill. &ldquo;How did they look?&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;They is red blackbirds,&rdquo; he returned.
This was not the first time I had heard the
red-wing called the ricebird. But how did
the boy know me for a bird-gazer? That
was a mystery. It came over me all at once
that possibly I had become better known in
the community than I had in the least suspected;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">« 162 »</a></span>
and then I remembered my field-glass.
That, as I could not help being
aware, was an object of continual attention.
Every day I saw people, old and young,
black and white, looking at it with undisguised
curiosity. Often they passed audible
comments upon it among themselves. &ldquo;How
far can you see through the spyglass?&rdquo; a
bolder spirit would now and then venture to
ask; and once, on the railway track out in
the pine lands, a barefooted, happy-faced
urchin made a guess that was really admirable
for its ingenuity. &ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;re
goin' over inspectin' the wire,&rdquo; he remarked.
On rare occasions, as an act of special grace,
I offered such an inquirer a peep through the
magic lenses,&mdash;an experiment that never
failed to elicit exclamations of wonder.
Things were so near! And the observer
looked comically incredulous, on putting
down the glass, to find how suddenly the
landscape had slipped away again. More
than one colored man wanted to know its
price, and expressed a fervent desire to
possess one like it; and probably, if I had
ever been assaulted and robbed in all my
solitary wanderings through the flat-woods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">« 163 »</a></span>
and other lonesome places, my &ldquo;spyglass&rdquo;
rather than my purse&mdash;the &ldquo;lust of the
eye&rdquo; rather than the &ldquo;pride of life&rdquo;&mdash;would
have been to thank.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> He did not say &ldquo;upon&rdquo; any more than Northern
white boys do.</p></div>

<p>Here, however, there could be no thought
of such a contingency. Here were no vagabonds
(one inoffensive Yankee specimen
excepted), but hard-working people going
into the city or out again, each on his own
lawful business. Scarcely one of them, man
or woman, but greeted me kindly. One, a
white man on horseback, invited, and even
urged me, to mount his horse, and let him
walk a piece. I must be fatigued, he was
sure,&mdash;how could I help it?&mdash;and he
would as soon walk as not. Finding me
obstinate, he walked his horse at my side,
chatting about the country, the trees, and
the crops. He it was who called my particular
attention to the abundance of blackberry
vines. &ldquo;Are the berries sweet?&rdquo; I
asked. He smacked his lips. &ldquo;Sweet as
honey, and big as that,&rdquo; measuring off a
liberal portion of his thumb. I spoke of
them half an hour later to a middle-aged
colored man. Yes, he said, the blackberries
were plenty enough and sweet enough; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">« 164 »</a></span>,
for his part, he didn&rsquo;t trouble them a great
deal. The vines (and he pointed at them,
fringing the roadside indefinitely) were
great places for rattlesnakes. He liked the
berries, but he liked somebody else to pick
them. He was awfully afraid of snakes;
they were so dangerous. &ldquo;Yes, sir&rdquo; (this
in answer to an inquiry), &ldquo;there are plenty
of rattlesnakes here clean up to Christmas.&rdquo;
I liked him for his frank avowal of cowardice,
and still more for his quiet bearing.
He remembered the days of slavery,&mdash;&ldquo;before
the surrender,&rdquo; as the current Southern
phrase is,&mdash;and his face beamed when I
spoke of my joy in thinking that his people
were free, no matter what might befall
them. He, too, raised cotton on hired land,
and was bringing up his children&mdash;there
were eight of them, he said&mdash;to habits of
industry.</p>

<p>My second stroll toward St. Augustine
carried me perhaps three miles,&mdash;say one
sixty-sixth of the entire distance,&mdash;and
none of my subsequent excursions took me
any farther; and having just now commended
a negro for his candor, I am moved
to acknowledge that, between the sand underfoot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">« 165 »</a></span>
and the sun overhead, I found the
six miles, which I spent at least four hours
in accomplishing, more fatiguing than twice
that distance would have been over New
Hampshire hills. If I were to settle in that
country, I should probably fall into the
way of riding more, and walking less. I
remember thinking how comfortable a certain
ponderous black mammy looked, whom
I met on one of these same sunny and sandy
tramps. She sat in the very middle of a
tipcart, with an old and truly picturesque
man&rsquo;s hat on her head (quite in the fashion,
feminine readers will notice), driving a one-horned
ox with a pair of clothes-line reins.
She was traveling slowly, just as I like to
travel; and, as I say, I was impressed by
her comfortable appearance. Why would
not an equipage like that be just the thing
for a naturalistic idler?</p>

<p>Not far beyond my halting-place of two
days before I came to a Cherokee rosebush,
one of the most beautiful of plants,&mdash;white,
fragrant, single roses (<i>real</i> roses) set in the
midst of the handsomest of glossy green
leaves. I was delighted to find it still in
flower. A hundred miles farther south I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">« 166 »</a></span>
had seen it finishing its season a full month
earlier. I stopped, of course, to pluck a
blossom. At that moment a female redbird
flew out of the bush. Her mate was beside
her instantly, and a nameless something in
their manner told me they were trying to
keep a secret. The nest, built mainly of
pine needles and other leaves, was in the
middle of the bush, a foot or two from the
grass, and contained two bluish or greenish
eggs thickly spattered with dark brown. I
meant to look into it again (the owners
seemed to have no great objection), but
somehow missed it every time I passed.
From that point, as far as I went, the road
was lined with Cherokee roses,&mdash;not continuously,
but with short intermissions; and
from the number of redbirds seen, almost
invariably in pairs, I feel safe in saying that
the nest I had found was probably one of
fifteen or twenty scattered along the wayside.
How gloriously the birds sang! It
was their day for singing. I was ready to
christen the road anew,&mdash;Redbird Road.</p>

<p>But the redbirds, many and conspicuous
as they were, had no monopoly of the road
or of the day. House wrens were equally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">« 167 »</a></span>
numerous and equally at home, though they
sang more out of sight. Red-eyed chewinks,
still far from their native berry pastures,
hopped into a bush to cry, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;
at the passing of a stranger, in whom, for
aught I know, they may have half recognized
an old acquaintance. A bunch of quails ran
across the road a little in front of me, and
in another place fifteen or twenty red-winged
blackbirds (not a red wing among them) sat
gossiping in a treetop. Elsewhere, even
later than this (it was now April 7), I saw
flocks, every bird of which wore shoulder-straps,&mdash;like
the traditional militia company,
all officers. <i>They</i> did not gossip, of
course (it is the male that sports the red),
but they made a lively noise.</p>

<p>As for the mocking-birds, they were at
the front here, as they were everywhere.
During my fortnight in Tallahassee there
were never many consecutive five minutes of
daylight in which, if I stopped to listen,
I could not hear at least one mocker.
Oftener two or three were singing at once
in as many different directions. And,
speaking of them, I must speak also of their
more northern cousin. From the day I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">« 168 »</a></span>
entered Florida I had been saying that the
mocking-bird, save for his occasional mimicry
of other birds, sang so exactly like the
thrasher that I did not believe I could tell
one from the other. Now, however, on this
St. Augustine road, I suddenly became
aware of a bird singing somewhere in advance,
and as I listened again I said aloud,
with full persuasion, &ldquo;There! that&rsquo;s a
thrasher!&rdquo; There was a something of difference;
a shade of coarseness in the voice,
perhaps; a tendency to force the tone, as
we say of human singers,&mdash;a <i>something</i>, at
all events, and the longer I hearkened, the
more confident I felt that the bird was a
thrasher. And so it was,&mdash;the first one I
had heard in Florida, although I had seen
many. Probably the two birds have peculiarities
of voice and method that, with
longer familiarity on the listener&rsquo;s part,
would render them easily distinguishable.
On general principles, I must believe that
to be true of all birds. But the experience
just described is not to be taken as proving
that <i>I</i> have any such familiarity.
Within a week afterward, while walking
along the railway, I came upon a thrasher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">« 169 »</a></span>
and a mocking-bird singing side by side;
the mocker upon a telegraph pole, and the
thrasher on the wire, half-way between the
mocker and the next pole. They sang and
sang, while I stood between them in the cut
below and listened; and if my life had depended
on my seeing how one song differed
from the other, I could not have done it.
With my eyes shut, the birds might have
changed places,&mdash;if they could have done
it quickly enough,&mdash;and I should have
been none the wiser.</p>

<p>As I have said, I followed the road over
the nearly level plateau for what I guessed
to be about three miles. Then I found myself
in a bit of hollow that seemed made
for a stopping-place, with a plantation road
running off to the right, and a hillside cornfield
of many acres on the left. In the field
were a few tall dead trees. At the tip of
one sat a sparrow-hawk, and to the trunk
of another clung a red-bellied woodpecker,
who, with characteristic foolishness, sat beside
his hole calling persistently, and then,
as if determined to publish what other birds
so carefully conceal, went inside, thrust out
his head, and resumed his clatter. Here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">« 170 »</a></span>
too, were a pair of bluebirds, noticeable for
their rarity, and for the wonderful color&mdash;a
shade deeper than is ever seen at the
North, I think&mdash;of the male&rsquo;s blue coat.
In a small thicket in the hollow beside the
road were noisy white-eyed vireos, a ruby-crowned
kinglet,&mdash;a tiny thing that within
a month would be singing in Canada, or
beyond,&mdash;an unseen wood pewee, and (also
unseen) a hermit thrush, one of perhaps
twenty solitary individuals that I found
scattered about the woods in the course of
my journeyings. Not one of them sang a
note. Probably they did not know that
there was a Yankee in Florida who&mdash;in
some moods, at least&mdash;would have given
more for a dozen bars of hermit thrush music
than for a day and a night of the mocking-bird&rsquo;s
medley. Not that I mean to disparage
the great Southern performer; as a
vocalist he is so far beyond the hermit thrush
as to render a comparison absurd; but what
I love is a <i>singer</i>, a voice to reach the soul.
An old Tallahassee negro, near the &ldquo;white
Norman school,&rdquo;&mdash;so he called it,&mdash;hit off
the mocking-bird pretty well. I had called
his attention to one singing in an adjacent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">« 171 »</a></span>
dooryard. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I love to hear
&lsquo;em. They&rsquo;s very amusin&rsquo;, very amusin'.&rdquo;
My own feeling can hardly be a prejudice,
conscious or unconscious, in favor of what
has grown dear to me through early and
long-continued association. The difference
between the music of birds like the mocker,
the thrasher, and the catbird and that of
birds like the hermit, the veery, and the
wood thrush is one of kind, not of degree;
and I have heard music of the mocking-bird&rsquo;s
kind (the thrasher&rsquo;s, that is to say)
as long as I have heard music at all. The
question is one of taste, it is true; but it is
not a question of familiarity or favoritism.
All praise to the mocker and the thrasher!
May their tribe increase! But if we are to
indulge in comparisons, give me the wood
thrush, the hermit, and the veery; with
tones that the mocking-bird can never imitate,
and a simplicity which the Fates&mdash;the
wise Fates, who will have variety&mdash;have
put forever beyond his appreciation and his
reach.</p>

<p>Florida as I saw it (let the qualification
be noted) is no more a land of flowers than
New England. In some respects, indeed, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">« 172 »</a></span>
is less so. Flowering shrubs and climbers
there are in abundance. I rode in the cars
through miles on miles of flowering dogwood
and pink azalea. Here, on this Tallahassee
road, were miles of Cherokee roses,
with plenty of the climbing scarlet honeysuckle
(beloved of humming-birds, although
I saw none here), and nearer the city, as
already described, masses of lantana and
white honeysuckle. In more than one place
pink double roses (vagrants from cultivated
grounds, no doubt) offered buds and blooms
to all who would have them. The cross-vine
(<i>Bignonia</i>), less freehanded, hung its showy
bells out of reach in the treetops. Thorn-bushes
of several kinds were in flower (a
puzzling lot), and the treelike blueberry
(<i>Vaccinium arboreum</i>), loaded with its
large, flaring white corollas, was a real spectacle
of beauty. Here, likewise, I found
one tiny crab-apple shrub, with a few blossoms,
exquisitely tinted with rose-color, and
most exquisitely fragrant. But the New
Englander, when he talks of wild flowers,
has in his eye something different from
these. He is not thinking of any bush,
no matter how beautiful, but of trailing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">« 173 »</a></span>
arbutus, hepaticas, bloodroot, anemones,
saxifrage, violets, dogtooth violets, spring
beauties, &ldquo;cowslips,&rdquo; buttercups, corydalis,
columbine, Dutchman&rsquo;s breeches, clintonia,
five-finger, and all the rest of that bright
and fragrant host which, ever since he can
remember, he has seen covering his native
hills and valleys with the return of May.</p>

<p>It is not meant, of course, that plants
like these are wholly wanting in Florida. I
remember an abundance of violets, blue and
white, especially in the flat-woods, where
also I often found pretty butterworts of two
or three sorts. The smaller blue ones took
very acceptably the place of hepaticas, and
indeed I heard them called by that name.
But, as compared with what one sees in New
England, such &ldquo;ground flowers,&rdquo; flowers
which it seems perfectly natural to pluck
for a nosegay, were very little in evidence.
I heard Northern visitors remark the fact
again and again. On this pretty road out
of Tallahassee&mdash;itself a city of flower gardens&mdash;I
can recall nothing of the kind
except half a dozen strawberry blossoms,
and the oxalis and specularia before mentioned.
Probably the round-leaved houstonia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">« 174 »</a></span>
grew here, as it did everywhere, in
small scattered patches. If there were violets
as well, I can only say I have forgotten
them.</p>

<p>Be it added, however, that at the time I
did not miss them. In a garden of roses
one does not begin by sighing for mignonette
and lilies of the valley. Violets or no violets,
there was no lack of beauty. The Southern
highway surveyor, if such a personage exists,
is evidently not consumed by that distressing
puritanical passion for &ldquo;slicking up things&rdquo;
which too often makes of his Northern
brother something scarcely better than a public
nuisance. At the South you will not find
a woman cultivating with pain a few exotics
beside the front door, while her husband is
mowing and burning the far more attractive
wild garden that nature has planted just outside
the fence. The St. Augustine road, at
any rate, after climbing the hill and getting
beyond the wood, runs between natural
hedges,&mdash;trees, vines, and shrubs carelessly
intermingled,&mdash;not dense enough to conceal
the prospect or shut out the breeze
(&ldquo;straight from the Gulf,&rdquo; as the Tallahassean
is careful to inform you), but sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">« 175 »</a></span>
to afford much welcome protection from the
sun. Here it was good to find the sassafras
growing side by side with the persimmon, although
when, for old acquaintance' sake, I
put a leaf into my mouth I was half glad to
fancy it a thought less savory than some I
had tasted in Yankeeland. I took a kind of
foolish satisfaction, too, in the obvious fact
that certain plants&mdash;the sumach and the
Virginia creeper, to mention no others&mdash;were
less at home here than a thousand miles
farther north. With the wild-cherry trees, I
was obliged to confess, the case was reversed.
I had seen larger ones in Massachusetts, perhaps,
but none that looked half so clean and
thrifty. In truth, their appearance was a
puzzle, rum-cherry trees as by all tokens they
undoubtedly were, till of a sudden it flashed
upon me that there were no caterpillars' nests
in them! Then I ceased to wonder at their
odd look. It spoke well for my botanical
acumen that I had recognized them at all.</p>

<p>Before I had been a week in Tallahassee
I found that, without forethought or plan, I
had dropped into the habit (and how pleasant
it is to think that some good habits can
be dropped into!) of making the St. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">« 176 »</a></span>Augustine
road my after-dinner sauntering-place.
The morning was for a walk: to Lake Bradford,
perhaps, in search of a mythical ivory-billed
woodpecker, or westward on the railway
for a few miles, with a view to rare
migratory warblers. But in the afternoon I
did not walk,&mdash;I loitered; and though I still
minded the birds and flowers, I for the most
part forgot my botany and ornithology. In
the cool of the day, then (the phrase is an
innocent euphemism), I climbed the hill,
and after an hour or two on the plateau
strolled back again, facing the sunset through
a vista of moss-covered live-oaks and sweet
gums. Those quiet, incurious hours are
among the pleasantest of all my Florida
memories. A cuckoo would be cooing, perhaps;
or a quail, with cheerful ambiguity,&mdash;such
as belongs to weather predictions in
general,&mdash;would be prophesying &ldquo;more
wet&rdquo; and &ldquo;no more wet&rdquo; in alternate
breaths; or two or three night-hawks would
be sweeping back and forth high above the
valley; or a marsh hawk would be quartering
over the big oatfield. The martins would be
cackling, in any event, and the kingbirds
practicing their aerial mock somersaults; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">« 177 »</a></span>
the mocking-bird would be singing, and the
redbird whistling. On the western slope,
just below the oatfield, the Northern woman
who owned the pretty cottage there (the
only one on the road) was sure to be at work
among her flowers. A laughing colored boy
who did chores for her (without injury to his
health, I could warrant) told me that she was
a Northerner. But I knew it already; I
needed no witness but her beds of petunias.
In the valley, as I crossed the railroad track,
a loggerhead shrike sat, almost of course, on
the telegraph wire in dignified silence; and
just beyond, among the cabins, I had my
choice of mocking-birds and orchard orioles.
And so, admiring the roses and the pomegranates,
the lantanas and the honeysuckles,
or chatting with some dusky fellow-pilgrim,
I mounted the hill to the city, and likely as
not saw before me a red-headed woodpecker
sitting on the roof of the State House, calling
attention to his patriotic self&mdash;in his tri-colored
dress&mdash;by occasional vigorous tattoos
on the tinned ridgepole. I never saw
him there without gladness. The legislature
had begun its session in an economical
mood,&mdash;as is more or less the habit of legislatures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">« 178 »</a></span>
I believe,&mdash;and was even considering
a proposition to reduce the salary and
mileage of its members. Under such circumstances,
it ought not to have been a matter
of surprise, perhaps, that no flag floated
from the cupola of the capitol. The people&rsquo;s
money should not be wasted. And possibly
I should never have remarked the omission
but for a certain curiosity, natural, if not inevitable,
on the part of a Northern visitor, as
to the real feeling of the South toward the
national government. Day after day I had
seen a portly gentleman&mdash;with an air, or
with airs, as the spectator might choose to
express it&mdash;going in and out of the State
House gate, dressed ostentatiously in a suit
of Confederate gray. He had worn nothing
else since the war, I was told. But of course
the State of Florida was not to be judged by
the freak of one man, and he only a member
of the &ldquo;third house.&rdquo; And even when I
went into the governor&rsquo;s office, and saw the
original &ldquo;ordinance of secession&rdquo; hanging
in a conspicuous place on the wall, as if it
were an heirloom to be proud of, I felt no
stirring of sectional animosity, thorough-bred
Massachusetts Yankee and old-fashioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">« 179 »</a></span>
abolitionist as I am. A brave people can
hardly be expected or desired to forget its
history, especially when that history has to
do with sacrifices and heroic deeds. But
these things, taken together, did no doubt
prepare me to look upon it as a happy coincidence
when, one morning, I heard the familiar
cry of the red-headed woodpecker, for
the first time in Florida, and looked up to
see him flying the national colors from the
ridgepole of the State House. I did not
break out with &ldquo;Three cheers for the red,
white, and blue!&rdquo; I am naturally undemonstrative;
but I said to myself that <i>Melanerpes
erythrocephalus</i> was a very handsome
bird.</p>

<p>On one of my first jaunts into the suburbs
of Tallahassee I noticed not far from
the road a bit of swamp,&mdash;shallow pools
with muddy borders and flats. It was a
likely spot for &ldquo;waders,&rdquo; and would be
worth a visit. To reach it, indeed, I must
cross a planted field surrounded by a lofty
barbed-wire fence and placarded against
trespassers; but there was no one in sight,
or no one who looked at all like a land-owner;
and, besides, it could hardly be accounted
a trespass&mdash;defined by Blackstone
as an &ldquo;<i>unwarranted</i> entry on another&rsquo;s
soil&rdquo;&mdash;to step carefully over the cotton-rows
on so legitimate an errand. Ordinarily
I call myself a simple bird-gazer, an amateur,
a field naturalist, if you will; but on
occasions like the present I assume&mdash;with
myself, that is&mdash;all the rights and titles of
an ornithologist proper, a man of science
strictly so called. In the interest of science,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">« 181 »</a></span>
then, I climbed the fence and picked my
way across the field. True enough, about
the edges of the water were two or three
solitary sandpipers, and at least half a
dozen of the smaller yellowlegs,&mdash;two additions
to my Florida list,&mdash;not to speak of
a little blue heron and a green heron, the
latter in most uncommonly green plumage.
It was well I had interpreted the placard
a little generously. &ldquo;The letter killeth&rdquo;
is a pretty good text in emergencies of this
kind. So I said to myself. The herons,
meanwhile, had taken French leave, but
the smaller birds were less suspicious; I
watched them at my leisure, and left them
still feeding.</p>

<p>Two days later I was there again, but it
must be acknowledged that this time I tarried
in the road till a man on horseback had
disappeared round the next turn. It would
have been manlier, without doubt, to pay
no attention to him; but something told me
that he was the cotton-planter himself, and,
for better or worse, prudence carried the day
with me. Finding nothing new, though the
sandpipers and yellowlegs were still present,
with a very handsome little blue heron and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">« 182 »</a></span>
plenty of blackbirds, I took the road again
and went further, and an hour or two afterward,
on getting back to the same place, was
overtaken again by the horseman. He
pulled up his horse and bade me good-afternoon.
Would I lend him my opera-glass,
which happened to be in my hand at the
moment? &ldquo;I should like to see how my
house looks from here,&rdquo; he said; and he
pointed across the field to a house on the
hill some distance beyond. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said I,
glad to set myself right by a piece of frankness
that under the circumstances could
hardly work to my disadvantage; &ldquo;then it
is your land on which I have been trespassing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; he asked, with a
smile; and I explained that I had been
across his cotton-field a little while before.
&ldquo;That is no trespass,&rdquo; he answered (so the
reader will perceive that I had been quite
correct in my understanding of the law);
and when I went on to explain my object in
visiting his cane-swamp (for such it was, he
said, but an unexpected freshet had ruined
the crop when it was barely out of the
ground), he assured me that I was welcome
to visit it as often as I wished. He himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">« 183 »</a></span>
was very fond of natural history, and often
regretted that he had not given time to it
in his youth. As it was, he protected the
birds on his plantation, and the place was
full of them. I should find his woods interesting,
he felt sure. Florida was extremely
rich in birds; he believed there were some
that had never been classified. &ldquo;We have
orioles here,&rdquo; he added; and so far, at any
rate, he was right; I had seen perhaps
twenty that day (orchard orioles, that is),
and one sat in a tree before us at the moment.
His whole manner was most kindly
and hospitable,&mdash;as was that of every Tallahassean
with whom I had occasion to speak,&mdash;and
I told him with sincere gratitude that
I should certainly avail myself of his courtesy
and stroll through his woods.</p>

<p>I approached them, two mornings afterward,
from the opposite side, where, finding
no other place of entrance, I climbed a
six-barred, tightly locked gate&mdash;feeling all
the while like &ldquo;a thief and a robber &rdquo;&mdash;in
front of a deserted cabin. Then I had only
to cross a grassy field, in which meadow larks
were singing, and I was in the woods. I
wandered through them without finding anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">« 184 »</a></span>
more unusual or interesting than summer
tanagers and yellow-throated warblers,
which were in song there, as they were in
every such place, and after a while came out
into a pleasant glade, from which different
parts of the plantation could be seen, and
through which ran a plantation road. Here
was a wooden fence,&mdash;a most unusual thing,&mdash;and
I lost no time in mounting it, to rest
and look about me. It is one of the marks
of a true Yankee, I suspect, to like such a
perch. My own weakness in that direction
is a frequent subject of mirth with chance
fellow travelers. The attitude is comfortable
and conducive to meditation; and now
that I was seated and at my ease, I felt that
this was one of the New England luxuries
which, almost without knowing it, I had
missed ever since I left home.</p>

<p>Of my meditations on this particular occasion
I remember nothing; but that is no
sign they were valueless; as it is no sign
that yesterday&rsquo;s dinner did me no good because
I have forgotten what it was. In the
latter case, indeed, and perhaps in the former
as well, it would seem more reasonable
to draw an exactly opposite inference. But,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">« 185 »</a></span>
quibbles apart, one thing I do remember: I
sat for some time on the fence, in the shade
of a tree, with an eye upon the cane-swamp
and an ear open for bird-voices. Yes, and
it comes to me at this moment that here I
heard the first and only bull-frog that I heard
anywhere in Florida. It was like a voice
from home, and belonged with the fence.
Other frogs I had heard in other places.
One chorus brought me out of bed in Daytona&mdash;in
the evening&mdash;after a succession
of February dog-day showers. &ldquo;What is
that noise outside?&rdquo; I inquired of the land-lady
as I hastened downstairs. &ldquo;That?&rdquo;
said she, with a look of amusement; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
frogs.&rdquo; &ldquo;It <i>may</i> be,&rdquo; I thought, but I
followed the sounds till they led me in the
darkness to the edge of a swamp. No doubt
the creatures were frogs, but of some kind
new to me, with voices more lugubrious
and homesick than I should have supposed
could possibly belong to any batrachian. A
week or two later, in the New Smyrna flat-woods,
I heard in the distance a sound which
I took for the grunting of pigs. I made
a note of it, mentally, as a cheerful token,
indicative of a probable scarcity of rattlesnakes;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">« 186 »</a></span>
but by and by, as I drew nearer,
the truth of the matter began to break upon
me. A man was approaching, and when
we met I asked him what was making that
noise yonder. &ldquo;Frogs,&rdquo; he said. At another
time, in the flat-woods of Port Orange
(I hope I am not taxing my reader&rsquo;s credulity
too far, or making myself out a man of
too imaginative an ear), I heard the bleating
of sheep. Busy with other things, I did not
stop to reflect that it was impossible there
should be sheep in that quarter, and the
occurrence had quite passed out of my
mind when, one day, a cracker, talking about
frogs, happened to say, &ldquo;Yes, and we have
one kind that makes a noise exactly like the
bleating of sheep.&rdquo; That, without question,
was what I had heard in the flat-woods. But
this frog in the sugar-cane swamp was the
same fellow that on summer evenings, ever
and ever so many years ago, in sonorous bass
that could be heard a quarter of a mile away,
used to call from Reuben Loud&rsquo;s pond,
&ldquo;Pull him in I Pull him in!&rdquo; or sometimes
(the inconsistent amphibian), &ldquo;Jug o'
rum! Jug o' rum!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I dismounted from my perch at last, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">« 187 »</a></span>
was sauntering idly along the path (idleness
like this is often the best of ornithological
industry), when suddenly I had a vision!
Before me, in the leafy top of an oak sapling,
sat a blue grosbeak. I knew him on
the instant. But I could see only his head
and neck, the rest of his body being hidden
by the leaves. It was a moment of feverish
excitement. Here was a new bird, a bird
about which I had felt fifteen years of curiosity;
and, more than that, a bird which here
and now was quite unexpected, since it was
not included in either of the two Florida
lists that I had brought with me from home.
For perhaps five seconds I had my opera-glass
on the blue head and the thick-set,
dark bill, with its lighter-colored under
mandible. Then I heard the clatter of a
horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and lifted my eyes. My friend
the owner of the plantation was coming
down the road at a gallop, straight upon me.
If I was to see the grosbeak and make sure
of him, it must be done at once. I moved
to bring him fully into view, and he flew
into the thick of a pine-tree out of sight.</p>

<p>But the tree was not far off, and if Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
would pass me with a nod, the case was still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">« 188 »</a></span>
far from hopeless. A bright thought came
to me. I ran from the path with a great
show of eager absorption, leveled my glass
upon the pine-tree, and stood fixed. Perhaps
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; would take the hint. Alas!
he had too much courtesy to pass his own
guest without speaking. &ldquo;Still after the
birds?&rdquo; he said, as he checked his horse. I
responded, as I hope, without any symptom
of annoyance. Then, of course, he wished to
know what I was looking at, and I told him
that a blue grosbeak had just flown into that
pine-tree, and that I was most distressingly
anxious to see more of him. He looked at
the pine-tree. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; he said.
No more could I. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a blue jay,
was it?&rdquo; he asked. And then we talked of
one thing and another, I have no idea what,
till he rode away to another part of the plantation
where a gang of women were at work.
By this time the grosbeak had disappeared
utterly. Possibly he had gone to a bit of
wood on the opposite side of the cane-swamp.
I scaled a barbed-wire fence and made in
that direction, but to no purpose. The grosbeak
was gone for good. Probably I should
never see another. Could the planter have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">« 189 »</a></span>
read my thoughts just then he would perhaps
have been angry with himself, and pretty
certainly he would have been angry with me.
That a Yankee should accept his hospitality,
and then load him with curses and call him
all manner of names! How should he know
that I was so insane a hobbyist as to care
more for the sight of a new bird than for all
the laws and customs of ordinary politeness?
As my feelings cooled, I saw that I was stepping
over hills or rows of some strange-looking
plants just out of the ground. Peanuts,
I guessed; but to make sure I called to a
colored woman who was hoeing not far off.
&ldquo;What are these?&rdquo; &ldquo;Finders,&rdquo; she answered.
I knew she meant peanuts,&mdash;otherwise
&ldquo;ground-peas&rdquo; and &ldquo;goobers,&rdquo;&mdash;and
now that I once more have a dictionary at my
elbow I learn that the word, like &ldquo;goober,&rdquo;
is, or is supposed to be, of African origin.</p>

<p>I was preparing to surmount the barbed-wire
fence again, when the planter returned
and halted for another chat. It was evident
that he took a genuine and amiable interest
in my researches. There were a great many
kinds of sparrows in that country, he said,
and also of woodpeckers. He knew the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">« 190 »</a></span>
ivory-bill, but, like other Tallahasseans, he
thought I should have to go into Lafayette
County (all Florida people say La<i>fay</i>ette)
to find it. &ldquo;That bird calling now is a bee-bird,&rdquo;
he said, referring to a kingbird; &ldquo;and
we have a bird that is called the French
mocking-bird; he catches other birds.&rdquo; The
last remark was of interest for its bearing
upon a point about which I had felt some
curiosity, and, I may say, some skepticism,
as I had seen many loggerhead shrikes, but
had observed no indication that other birds
feared them or held any grudge against them.
As he rode off he called my attention to a
great blue heron just then flying over the
swamp. &ldquo;They are very shy,&rdquo; he said.
Then, from further away, he shouted once
more to ask if I heard the mocking-bird
singing yonder, pointing with his whip in
the direction of the singer.</p>

<p>For some time longer I hung about the
glade, vainly hoping that the grosbeak would
again favor my eyes. Then I crossed more
planted fields,&mdash;climbing more barbed-wire
fences, and stopping on the way to enjoy the
sweetly quaint music of a little chorus of
white-crowned sparrows,&mdash;and skirted once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">« 191 »</a></span>
more the muddy shore of the cane-swamp,
where the yellowlegs and sandpipers were
still feeding. That brought me to the road
from which I had made my entry to the
place some days before; but, being still
unable to forego a splendid possibility, I
recrossed the plantation, tarried again in
the glade, sat again on the wooden fence (if
that grosbeak only <i>would</i> show himself!),
and thence went on, picking a few heads of
handsome buffalo clover, the first I had ever
seen, and some sprays of penstemon, till I
came again to the six-barred gate and the
Quincy road. At that point, as I now remember,
the air was full of vultures (carrion
crows), a hundred or more, soaring over the
fields in some fit of gregariousness. Along
the road were white-crowned and white-throated
sparrows (it was the 12th of April),
orchard orioles, thrashers, summer tanagers,
myrtle and palm warblers, cardinal grosbeaks,
mocking-birds, kingbirds, loggerheads,
yellow-throated vireos, and sundry
others, but not the blue grosbeak, which
would have been worth them all.</p>

<p>Once back at the hotel, I opened my
Coues&rsquo;s Key to refresh my memory as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">« 192 »</a></span>
the exact appearance of that bird. &ldquo;Feathers
around base of bill black,&rdquo; said the book.
I had not noticed that. But no matter; the
bird was a blue grosbeak, for the sufficient
reason that it could not be anything else.
A black line between the almost black beak
and the dark-blue head would be inconspicuous
at the best, and quite naturally would
escape a glimpse so hasty as mine had been.
And yet, while I reasoned in this way, I
foresaw plainly enough that, as time passed,
doubt would get the better of assurance,
as it always does, and I should never be certain
that I had not been the victim of some
illusion. At best, the evidence was worth
nothing for others. If only that excellent
Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, for whose kindness I was unfeignedly
thankful (and whose pardon I most
sincerely beg if I seem to have been a bit too
free in this rehearsal of the story),&mdash;if only
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; could have left me alone for ten
minutes longer!</p>

<p>The worry and the imprecations were
wasted, after all, as, Heaven be thanked,
they so often are; for within two or three
days I saw other blue grosbeaks and heard
them sing. But that was not on a cotton
plantation, and is part of another story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> pilgrims to Tallahassee visit the Murat
place. It is one of the most conveniently
accessible of those &ldquo;points of interest&rdquo; with
which guide-books so anxiously, and with so
much propriety, concern themselves. What
a tourist prays for is something to see. If
I had ever been a tourist in Boston, no
doubt I should before now have surveyed
the world from the top of the Bunker Hill
monument. In Tallahassee, at all events, I
went to the Murat estate. In fact, I went
more than once; but I remember especially
my first visit, which had a livelier sentimental
interest than the others because I
was then under the agreeable delusion that
the Prince himself had lived there. The
guide-book told me so, vouchsafing also the
information that after building the house he
&ldquo;interested himself actively in local affairs,
became a naturalized citizen, and served
successively as postmaster, alderman, and
mayor &rdquo;&mdash;a model immigrant, surely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">« 194 »</a></span>
though it is rather the way of immigrants,
perhaps, not to refuse political responsibilities.</p>

<p>Naturally, I remembered these things as
I stood in front of &ldquo;the big house &rdquo;&mdash;a
story-and-a-half cottage&mdash;amid the flowering
shrubs. Here lived once the son of the
King of Naples; himself a Prince, and&mdash;worthy
son of a worthy sire&mdash;alderman and
then mayor of the city of Tallahassee. Thus
did an uncompromising democrat pay court
to the shades of Royalty, while a mocking-bird
sang from a fringe-bush by the gate,
and an oriole flew madly from tree to tree
in pursuit of a fair creature of the reluctant
sex.</p>

<p>The inconsistency, if such it was, was
quickly punished. For, alas! when I spoke
of my morning&rsquo;s pilgrimage to an old resident
of the town, he told me that Murat
never lived in the house, nor anywhere else
in Tallahassee, and of course was never its
postmaster, alderman, or mayor. The Princess,
he said, built the house after her husband&rsquo;s
death, and lived there, a widow. I
appealed to the guide-book. My informant
sneered,&mdash;politely,&mdash;and brought me a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">« 195 »</a></span>
still older Tallahassean, Judge, whose
venerable name I am sorry to have forgotten,
and that indisputable citizen confirmed
all that his neighbor had said. For once,
the guide-book compiler must have been
misinformed.</p>

<p>The question, happily, was one of no great
consequence. If the Prince had never lived
in the house, the Princess had; and she, by
all accounts (and I make certain her husband
would have said the same), was the
worthier person of the two. And even if
neither of them had lived there, if my sentiment
had been <i>all</i> wasted (but there was
no question of tears), the place itself was
sightly, the house was old, and the way
thither a pleasant one&mdash;first down the hill
in a zig-zag course to the vicinity of the railway
station, then by a winding country road
through the valley past a few negro cabins,
and up the slope on the farther side. Prince
Murat, or no Prince Murat, I should love to
travel that road to-day, instead of sitting
before a Massachusetts fire, with the ground
deep under snow, and the air full of thirty
or forty degrees of frost.</p>

<p>In the front yard of one of the cabins opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">« 196 »</a></span>
the car-wheel foundry, and near the
station, as I now remember, a middle-aged
negress was cutting up an oak log. She
swung the axe with vigor and precision, and
the chips flew; but I could not help saying,
&ldquo;You ought to make the man do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She answered on the instant. &ldquo;I would,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;if I had a man to <i>make</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you would,&rdquo; I thought. Her
tongue was as sharp as her axe.</p>

<p>Ought I to have ventured a word in her
behalf, I wonder, when a man of her own
color, and a pretty near neighbor, told me
with admirable <i>näiveté</i> the story of his bereavement
and his hopes? His wife had
died a year before, he said, and so far,
though he had not let the grass grow under
his feet, he had found no one to take her
place. He still meant to do so, if he could.
He was only seventy-four years old, and it
was not good for a man to be alone. He
seemed a gentle spirit, and I withheld all
mention of the stalwart and manless wood-cutter.
I hope he went farther, and fared
better. So youthful as he was, surely there
was no occasion for haste.</p>

<p>When I had skirted a cotton-field&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">« 197 »</a></span>
crop just out of the ground&mdash;and a bit of
wood on the right, and a swamp with a splendid
display of white water-lilies on the left,
and had begun to ascend the gentle slope,
I met a man of considerably more than
seventy-four years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me just where the Murat
place is?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>He grinned broadly, and thought he could.
He was one of the old Murat servants, as
his father had been before him. &ldquo;I was
borned on to him,&rdquo; he said, speaking of the
Prince. Murat was &ldquo;a gentleman, sah.&rdquo;
That was a statement which it seemed impossible
for him to repeat often enough.
He spoke from a slave&rsquo;s point of view. Murat
was a good master. The old man had
heard him say that he kept servants &ldquo;for
the like of the thing.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t abuse
them. He &ldquo;never was for barbarizing a
poor colored person at all.&rdquo; Whipping?
Oh, yes. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t miss your fault. No,
sah, he didn&rsquo;t miss your fault.&rdquo; But his
servants never were &ldquo;ironed.&rdquo; He &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
believe in barbarousment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man was thankful to be free; but
to his mind emancipation had not made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">« 198 »</a></span>
everything heavenly. The younger set of
negroes (&ldquo;my people&rdquo; was his word) were
on the wrong road. They had &ldquo;sold their
birthright,&rdquo; though exactly what he meant
by that remark I did not gather. &ldquo;They
ain&rsquo;t got no sense,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and what
sense they has got don&rsquo;t do 'em no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him finally that I was from the
North. &ldquo;Oh, I knows it,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I
knows it;&rdquo; and he beamed with delight.
How did he know, I inquired. &ldquo;Oh, I
knows it. I can see it <i>in</i> you. Anybody
would know it that had any jedgment at all.
You&rsquo;s a perfect gentleman, sah.&rdquo; He was
too old to be quarreled with, and I swallowed
the compliment.</p>

<p>I tore myself away, or he might have run
on till night&mdash;about his old master and mistress,
the division of the estate, an abusive
overseer (&ldquo;he was a perfect dog, sah! &rdquo;), and
sundry other things. He had lived a long
time, and had nothing to do now but to recall
the past and tell it over. So it will be
with us, if we live so long. May we find
once in a while a patient listener.</p>

<p>This patriarch&rsquo;s unfavorable opinion as to
the prospects of the colored people was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">« 199 »</a></span>
shared by my hopeful young widower before
mentioned, who expressed himself quite as
emphatically. He was brought up among
white people (&ldquo;I&rsquo;s been taughted a heap,&rdquo;
he said), and believed that the salvation of
the blacks lay in their recognition of white
supremacy. But he was less perspicacious
than the older man. He was one of the
very few persons whom I met at the South
who did not recognize me at sight as a Yankee.
&ldquo;Are you a legislator-man?&rdquo; he
asked, at the end of our talk. The legislature
was in session on the hill. But perhaps,
after all, he only meant to flatter me.</p>

<p>If I am long on the way, it is because, as
I love always to have it, the going and coming
were the better part of the pilgrimage.
The estate itself is beautifully situated, with
far-away horizons; but it has fallen into
great neglect, while the house, almost in
ruins, and occupied by colored people, is to
Northern eyes hardly more than a larger
cabin. It put me in mind of the question
of a Western gentleman whom I met at St.
Augustine. He had come to Florida against
his will, the weather and the doctor having
combined against him, and was looking at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">« 200 »</a></span>
everything through very blue spectacles.
&ldquo;Have you seen any of those fine old country
mansions,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;about which we
read so often in descriptions of Southern
life?&rdquo; He had been on the lookout for
them, he averred, ever since he left home, and
had yet to find the first one; and from his
tone it was evident that he thought the
Southern idea of a &ldquo;fine old mansion&rdquo;
must be different from his.</p>

<p>The Murat house, certainly, was never a
palace, except as love may have made it so.
But it was old; people had lived in it, and
died in it; those who once owned it, whose
name and memory still clung to it, were
now in narrower houses; and it was easy
for the visitor&mdash;for one visitor, at least&mdash;to
fall into pensive meditation. I
strolled about the grounds; stood between
the last year&rsquo;s cotton-rows, while
a Carolina wren poured out his soul from
an oleander bush near by; admired the
confidence of a pair of shrikes, who had
made a nest in a honeysuckle vine in
the front yard; listened to the sweet music
of mocking-birds, cardinals, and orchard
orioles; watched the martins circling above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">« 201 »</a></span>
the trees; thought of the Princess, and
smiled at the black children who thrust
their heads out of the windows of her &ldquo;big
house;&rdquo; and then, with a sprig of honeysuckle
for a keepsake, I started slowly
homeward.</p>

<p>The sun by this time was straight overhead,
but my umbrella saved me from absolute
discomfort, while birds furnished here
and there an agreeable diversion. I recall
in particular some white-crowned sparrows,
the first ones I had seen in Florida. At a
bend in the road opposite the water-lily
swamp, while I was cooling myself in the
shade of a friendly pine-tree,&mdash;enjoying at
the same time a fence overrun with Cherokee
roses,&mdash;a man and his little boy came
along in a wagon. The man seemed really
disappointed when I told him that I was going
into town, instead of coming from it.
It was pretty warm weather for walking, and
he had meant to offer me a lift. He was a
Scandinavian, who had been for some years
in Florida. He owned a good farm not far
from the Murat estate, which latter he had
been urged to buy; but he thought a man
wasn&rsquo;t any better off for owning too much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">« 202 »</a></span>
land. He talked of his crops, his children,
the climate, and so on, all in a cheerful
strain, pleasant to hear. If the pessimists
are right,&mdash;which may I be kept from believing,&mdash;the
optimists are certainly more
comfortable to live with, though it be only
for ten minutes under a roadside shade-tree.</p>

<p>When I reached the street-car track at
the foot of the hill, the one car which plies
back and forth through the city was in its
place, with the driver beside it, but no
mules.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to start directly?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sah,&rdquo; he answered; and then, looking
toward the stable, he shouted in a peremptory
voice, &ldquo;Do about, there! Do
about!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Hurry
up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sah, that&rsquo;s it. &lsquo;T ain&rsquo;t everybody
that wants to be hurried up; so we tells 'em,
'Do about!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half a minute afterwards two very neatly
dressed little colored boys stepped upon the
rear platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you goin'?&rdquo; said the driver.
&ldquo;Uptown?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">« 203 »</a></span></p>

<p>They said they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, come inside. Stay out there, and
you&rsquo;ll git hurt and cost this dried-up company
more money than you&rsquo;s wuth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They dropped into seats by the rear door.
He motioned them to the front corner.
&ldquo;Sit down there,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;right there.&rdquo;
They obeyed, and as he turned away he
added, what I found more and more to be
true, as I saw more of him, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t de boss,
but I&rsquo;s got right smart to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he whistled to the mules, flourished
his whip, and to a persistent accompaniment
of whacks and whistles we went crawling up
the hill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I arrived</span> at Tallahassee, from Jacksonville,
late in the afternoon, after a hot and
dusty ride of more than eight hours. The
distance is only a hundred and sixty odd
miles, I believe; but with some bright exceptions.
Southern railroads, like Southern
men, seem to be under the climate, and
schedule time is more or less a formality.</p>

<p>For the first two thirds of the way the
country is flat and barren. Happily, I sat
within earshot of an amateur political economist,
who, like myself, was journeying to
the State capital. By birth and education
he was a New York State man, I heard
him say; an old abolitionist, who had voted
for Birney, Fremont, and all their successors
down to Hayes&mdash;the only vote he was ever
ashamed of. Now he was a &ldquo;greenbacker.&rdquo;
The country was going to the dogs, and all
because the government did not furnish
money enough. The people would find it
out some time, he guessed. He talked as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">« 205 »</a></span>
bird sings&mdash;for his own pleasure. But I
was pleased, too. His was an amiable enthusiasm,
quite exempt, as it seemed, from
all that bitterness, which an exclusive possession
of the truth so commonly engenders.
He was greatly in earnest; he knew he was
right; but he could still see the comical side
of things; he still had a sense of the ludicrous;
and in that lay his salvation. For a
sense of the ludicrous is the best of mental
antiseptics; it, if anything, will keep our
perishable human nature sweet, and save
it from the madhouse. His discourse was
punctuated throughout with quiet laughter.
Thus, when he said, &ldquo;<i>I</i> call it the <i>late</i> Republican
party,&rdquo; it was with a chuckle so
good-natured, so free from acidity and self-conceit,
that only a pretty stiff partisan
could have taken offense. Even his predictions
of impending national ruin were delivered
with numberless merry quips and
twinkles. Many good Republicans and
good Democrats (the adjective is used in its
political sense) might have envied him his
sunny temper, joined, as it was, to a good
stock of native shrewdness. For something
in his eye made it plain that, with all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">« 206 »</a></span>
other qualities, our merry greenbacker was
a reasonably competent band at a bargain;
so that I was not in the least surprised
when his seat-mate told me afterward, in a
tone of much respect, that the &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo;
owned a very comfortable property at St.
Augustine. But his best possession, I still
thought, was his humor and his own generous
appreciation of it. To enjoy one&rsquo;s own
jokes is to have a pretty safe insurance
against inward adversity.</p>

<p>Happily, I say, this good-humored talker
sat within hearing. Happily, too, it was
now&mdash;April 4&mdash;the height of the season
for flowering dogwood, pink azalea, fringe-bushes,
Cherokee roses, and water lilies.
All these had blossomed abundantly, and
mile after mile the wilderness and the solitary
place were glad for them. Here and
there, also, I caught flying glimpses of
some unknown plant bearing a long upright
raceme of creamy-white flowers. It might
be a white lupine, I thought, till at one of
our stops between stations it happened to be
growing within reach. Then I guessed it to
be a <i>Baptisia</i>, which guess was afterward
confirmed&mdash;to my regret; for the flowers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">« 207 »</a></span>
lost at once all their attractiveness. So
ineffaceable (oftenest for good, but this time
for ill) is an early impression upon the least
honorably esteemed of the five senses! As
a boy, it was one of my tasks to keep down
with a scythe the weeds and bushes in a
rocky, thin-soiled cattle pasture. In that
task,&mdash;which, at the best, was a little too
much like work&mdash;my most troublesome
enemy was the common wild indigo (<i>Baptisia
tinctoria</i>), partly from the wicked pertinacity
with which it sprang up again after
every mowing, but especially from the fact
that the cut or bruised stalk exhaled what
in my nostrils was a most abominable odor.
Other people do not find it so offensive, I
suspect, but to me it was, and is, ten times
worse than the more pungent but comparatively
salubrious perfume which a certain
handsome little black-and-white quadruped&mdash;handsome,
but impolite&mdash;is given to
scattering upon the nocturnal breeze in moments
of extreme perturbation.</p>

<p>Somewhere beyond the Suwanee River
(at which I looked as long as it remained in
sight&mdash;and thought of Christine Nilsson)
there came a sudden change in the aspect of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">« 208 »</a></span>
the country, coincident with a change in the
nature of the soil, from white sand to red
clay; a change indescribably exhilarating to
a New Englander who had been living, if only
for two months, in a country without hills.
How good it was to see the land rising,
though never so gently, as it stretched away
toward the horizon! My spirits rose with
it. By and by we passed extensive hillside
plantations, on which little groups of negroes,
men and women, were at work. I
seemed to see the old South of which I had
read and dreamed, a South not in the least
like anything to be found in the wilds of
southern and eastern Florida; a land of cotton,
and, better still, a land of Southern
people, instead of Northern tourists and settlers.
And when we stopped at a thrifty-looking
village, with neat, homelike houses,
open grounds, and lordly shade-trees, I
found myself saying under my breath, &ldquo;Now,
then, we are getting back into God&rsquo;s country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for Tallahassee itself, it was exactly
what I had hoped to find it: a typical Southern
town; not a camp in the woods, nor an
old city metamorphosed into a fashionable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">« 209 »</a></span>
winter resort; a place untainted by &ldquo;Northern
enterprise,&rdquo; whose inhabitants were unmistakably
at home, and whose houses, many
of them, at least, had no appearance of being
for sale. It is compactly built on a hill,&mdash;the
state capitol crowning the top,&mdash;down
the pretty steep sides of which run roads
into the open country all about. The roads,
too, are not so sandy but that it is comparatively
comfortable to walk in them&mdash;a
blessing which the pedestrian sorely misses
in the towns of lower Florida: at St. Augustine,
for example, where, as soon as one
leaves the streets of the city itself, walking
and carriage-riding alike become burdensome
and, for any considerable distance, all
but impossible. Here at Tallahassee, it was
plain, I should not be kept indoors for want
of invitations from without.</p>

<p>I arrived, as I have said, rather late in
the afternoon; so late that I did nothing
more than ramble a little about the city,
noting by the way the advent of the chimney
swifts, which I had not found elsewhere,
and returning to my lodgings with a handful
of &ldquo;banana-shrub&rdquo; blossoms,&mdash;smelling
wonderfully like their name,&mdash;which a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">« 210 »</a></span>
woman had insisted upon giving me when I
stopped beside the fence to ask her the
name of the bush. It was my first, but by
no means my last, experience of the floral
generosity of Tallahassee people.</p>

<p>The next morning I woke betimes, and to
my astonishment found the city enveloped
in a dense fog. The hotel clerk, an old
resident, to whom I went in my perplexity,
was as much surprised as his questioner.
He did not know what it could mean, he was
sure; it was very unusual; but he thought
it did not indicate foul weather. For a man
so slightly acquainted with such phenomena,
he proved to be a remarkably good prophet;
for though, during my fortnight&rsquo;s stay,
there must have been at least eight foggy
mornings, every day was sunny, and not a
drop of rain fell.</p>

<p>That first bright forenoon is still a bright
memory. For one thing, the mocking-birds
outsang themselves till I felt, and wrote,
that I had never heard mocking-birds before.
That they really did surpass their
brethren of St. Augustine and Sanford
would perhaps be too much to assert, but so
it seemed; and I was pleased, some months
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">« 211 »</a></span>
afterward, to come upon a confirmatory
judgment by Mr. Maurice Thompson, who,
if any one, must be competent to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were going to risk the reputation
of our country on the singing of a mocking-bird
against a European nightingale,&rdquo;
says Mr. Thompson,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> &ldquo;I should choose my
champion from the hill-country in the neighborhood
of Tallahassee, or from the environs
of Mobile.... I have found no birds elsewhere
to compare with those in that belt of
country about thirty miles wide, stretching
from Live Oak in Florida, by way of Tallahassee,
to some miles west of Mobile.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> <i>By-Ways and Bird-Notes</i>, p. 20.</p></div>

<p>I had gone down the hill past some negro
cabins, into a small, straggling wood,
and through the wood to a gate which let
me into a plantation lane. It was the fairest
of summer forenoons (to me, I mean;
by the almanac it was only the 5th of
April), and one of the fairest of quiet landscapes;
broad fields rising gently to the
horizon, and before me, winding upward, a
grassy lane open on one side, and bordered
on the other by a deep red gulch and a zig-zag
fence, along which grew vines, shrubs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">« 212 »</a></span>
and tall trees. The tender and varied tints
of the new leaves, the lively green of the
young grain, the dark ploughed fields, the
red earth of the wayside&mdash;I can see them
yet, with all that Florida sunshine on them.
In the bushes by the fence-row were a pair
of cardinal grosbeaks, the male whistling
divinely, quite unabashed by the volubility
of a mocking-bird who balanced himself on
the treetop overhead,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Superb and sole, upon a pluméd spray,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and seemed determined to show a Yankee
stranger what mocking-birds could really do
when they set out. He did his work well; the
love notes of the flicker could not have been
improved by the flicker himself; but, right or
wrong, I could not help feeling that the cardinal
struck a truer and deeper note; while
both together did not hinder me from hearing
the faint songs of grasshopper sparrows
rising from the ground on either side of the
lane. It was a fine contrast: the mocker
flooding the air from the topmost bough,
and the sparrows whispering their few almost
inaudible notes out of the grass. Yes,
and at the self-same moment the eye also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">« 213 »</a></span>
had its contrast; for a marsh hawk was
skimming over the field, while up in the
sky soared a pair of hen-hawks.</p>

<p>In the wood, composed of large trees, both
hard wood and pine, I had found a group of
three summer tanagers, two males and one
female,&mdash;the usual proportion with birds
generally, one may almost say, in the pairing
season. The female was the first of her
sex that I had seen, and I remarked with
pleasure the comparative brightness of her
dress. Among tanagers, as among negroes,
red and yellow are esteemed a pretty good
match. At this point, too, in a cluster of
pines, I caught a new song&mdash;faint and listless,
like the indigo-bird&rsquo;s, I thought; and
at the word I started forward eagerly.
Here, doubtless, was the indigo-bird&rsquo;s southern
congener, the nonpareil, or painted bunting,
a beauty which I had begun to fear I
was to miss. I had recognized my first
tanager from afar, ten days before, his voice
and theme were so like his Northern relative&rsquo;s;
but this time I was too hasty. My
listless singer was not the nonpareil, nor
even a finch of any kind, but a yellow-throated
warbler. For a month I had seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">« 214 »</a></span>
birds of his species almost daily, but always
in hard wood trees, and silent. Henceforth,
as long as I remained in Florida, they were
invariably in pines,&mdash;their summer quarters,&mdash;and
in free song. Their plumage is
of the neatest and most exquisite; few, even
among warblers, surpass them in that regard:
black and white (reminding one of
the black-and-white creeper, which they
resemble also in their feeding habits), with
a splendid yellow gorget. Myrtle warblers
(yellow-rumps) were still here (the peninsula
is alive with them in the winter), and a
ruby-crowned kinglet mingled its lovely
voice with the simple trills of pine warblers,
while out of a dense low treetop some invisible
singer was pouring a stream of fine-spun
melody. It should have been a house wren,
I thought (another was singing close by),
only its tune was several times too long.</p>

<p>At least four of my longer excursions into
the surrounding country (long, not intrinsically,
but by reason of the heat) were made
with a view to possible ivory-billed woodpeckers.
Just out of the town northward,
beyond what appeared to be the court end of
Marion Street, the principal business street
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">« 215 »</a></span>
of the city, I had accosted a gentleman in a
dooryard in front of a long, low, vine-covered,
romantic-looking house. He was evidently
at home, and not so busy as to make
an interruption probably intrusive. I inquired
the name of a tree, I believe. At all
events, I engaged him in conversation, and
found him most agreeable&mdash;an Ohio gentleman,
a man of science, who had been in the
South long enough to have acquired large
measures of Southern <i>insouciance</i> (there
are times when a French word has a politer
sound than any English equivalent), which
takes life as made for something better than
worry and pleasanter than hard work. He
had seen ivory-bills, he said, and thought I
might be equally fortunate if I would visit a
certain swamp, about which he would tell
me, or, better still, if I would go out to Lake
Bradford.</p>

<p>First, because it was nearer, I went to the
swamp, taking an early breakfast and setting
forth in a fog that was almost a mist, to
make as much of the distance as possible before
the sun came out. My course lay westward,
some four miles, along the railway
track, which, thanks to somebody, is provided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">« 216 »</a></span>
with a comfortable footpath of hard clay covering
the sleepers midway between the rails.
If all railroads were thus furnished they
might be recommended as among the best
of routes for walking naturalists, since they
go straight through the wild country. This
one carried me by turns through woodland
and cultivated field, upland and swamp, pine
land and hammock; and, happily, my expectations
of the ivory-bill were not lively
enough to quicken my steps or render me
heedless of things along the way.</p>

<p>Here I was equally surprised and delighted
by the sight of yellow jessamine still
in flower more than a month after I had
seen the end of its brief season, only a hundred
miles further south. So great, apparently,
is the difference between the peninsula
and this Tallahassee hill-country, which
by its physical geography seems rather to
be a part of Georgia than of Florida.
Here, too, the pink azalea was at its prettiest,
and the flowering dogwood, also, true
queen of the woods in Florida as in Massachusetts.
The fringe-bush, likewise, stood
here and there in solitary state, and thorn-bushes
flourished in bewildering variety.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">« 217 »</a></span>
Nearer the track were the omnipresent blackberry
vines, some patches of which are especially
remembered for their bright rosy
flowers.</p>

<p>Out of the dense vegetation of a swamp
came the cries of Florida gallinules, and
then, of a sudden, I caught, or seemed to
catch, the sweet <i>kurwee</i> whistle of a Carolina
rail. Instinctively I turned my ear for
its repetition, and by so doing admitted to
myself that I was not certain of what I had
heard, although the sora&rsquo;s call is familiar,
and the bird was reasonably near. I had
been taken unawares, and every ornithologist
knows how hard it is to be sure of one&rsquo;s
self in such a case. He knows, too, how
uncertain he feels of any brother observer
who in a similar case seems troubled by no
distrust of his own senses. The whistle,
whatever it had been, was not repeated, and
I lost my only opportunity of adding the
sora&rsquo;s name to my Florida catalogue&mdash;a
loss, fortunately, of no consequence to any
but myself, since the bird is well known as
a winter visitor to the State.</p>

<p>Further along, a great blue heron was
stalking about the edge of a marshy pool,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">« 218 »</a></span>
and further still, in a woody swamp, stood
three little blue herons, one of them in white
plumage. In the drier and more open parts
of the way cardinals, mocking-birds, and
thrashers were singing, ground doves were
cooing, quails were prophesying, and loggerhead
shrikes sat, trim and silent, on the
telegraph wire. In the pine lands were
plenty of brown-headed nuthatches, full, as
always, of friendly gossip; two red-shouldered
hawks, for whom life seemed to wear
a more serious aspect; three Maryland yellow-throats;
a pair of bluebirds, rare enough
now to be twice welcome; a black-and-white
creeper, and a yellow redpoll warbler. In
the same pine-woods, too, there was much
good music: house wrens, Carolina wrens,
red-eyed and white-eyed vireos, pine warblers,
yellow-throated warblers, blue yellow-backs,
red-eyed chewinks, and, twice welcome,
like the bluebirds, a Carolina chickadee.</p>

<p>A little beyond this point, in a cut through
a low sand bank, I found two pairs of rough-winged
swallows, and stopped for some time
to stare at them, being myself, meanwhile,
a gazing-stock for two or three negroes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">« 219 »</a></span>
lounging about the door of a cabin not far
away. It is a happy chance when a man&rsquo;s
time is <i>doubly</i> improved. Two of the birds&mdash;the
first ones I had ever seen, to be sure
of them&mdash;perched directly before me on
the wire, one facing me, the other with his
back turned. It was kindly done; and
then, as if still further to gratify my curiosity,
they visited a bole in the bank. A
second bole was doubtless the property of
the other pair. Living alternately in
heaven and in a hole in the ground, they
wore the livery of the earth.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;They are not fair to outward view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As many swallows be,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I said to myself. But I was not the less
glad to see them.</p>

<p>I should have been gladder for a sight of
the big woodpecker, whose reputed dwelling-place
lay not far ahead. But, though I
waited and listened, and went through the
swamp, and beyond it, I beard no strange
about, nor saw any strange bird; and toward
noon, just as the sun brushed away the fog,
I left the railway track for a carriage byway
which, I felt sure, must somehow bring
me back to the city. And so it did, past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">« 220 »</a></span>
here and there a house, till I came to the
main road, and then to the Murat estate,
and was again on familiar ground.</p>

<p>Two mornings afterward I made another
early and foggy start, this time for Lake
Bradford. My instructions were to follow
the railway for a mile or so beyond the
station, and then take a road bearing away
sharply to the left. This I did, making
sure I was on the right road by inquiring of
the first man I saw&mdash;a negro at work before
his cabin. I had gone perhaps half a
mile further when a white man, on his way
after a load of wood, as I judged, drove up
behind me. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you ride?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;You are going to Lake Bradford, I believe,
and I am going a piece in the same direction.&rdquo;
I jumped up behind (the wagon
consisting of two long planks fastened to the
two axles), thankful, but not without a little
bewilderment. The good-hearted negro, it
appeared, had asked the man to look out for
me; and he, on his part, seemed glad to do
a kindness as well as to find company. We
jolted along, chatting at arm&rsquo;s length, as it
were, about this and that. He knew nothing
of the ivory-bill; but wild turkeys&mdash;oh, yes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">« 221 »</a></span>
he had seen a flock of eight, as well as he
could count, not long before, crossing the
road in the very woods through which I was
going. As for snakes, they were plenty
enough, he guessed. One of his horses was
bitten while ploughing, and died in half
an hour. (A Florida man who cannot tell
at least one snake story may be set down
as having land to sell.) He thought it a
pretty good jaunt to the lake, and the road
wasn&rsquo;t any too plain, though no doubt I
should get there; but I began to perceive
that a white man who traveled such distances
on foot in that country was more of
a <i>rara avis</i> than any woodpecker.</p>

<p>Our roads diverged after a while, and my
own soon ran into a wood with an undergrowth
of saw palmetto. This was the place
for the ivory-bill, and as at the swamp two
days before, so now I stopped and listened,
and then stopped and listened again. The
Fates were still against me. There was neither
woodpecker nor turkey, and I pushed on,
mostly through pine-woods&mdash;full of birds,
but nothing new&mdash;till I came out at the lake.
Here, beside an idle sawmill and heaps of
sawdust, I was greeted by a solitary negro
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">« 222 »</a></span>,
well along in years, who demanded, in a tone
of almost comical astonishment, where in the
world I had come from. I told him from
Tallahassee, and he seemed so taken aback
that I began to think I must look uncommonly
like an invalid, a &ldquo;Northern consumptive,&rdquo;
perhaps. Otherwise, why should a
walk of six miles, or something less, be
treated as such a marvel? However, the
negro and I were soon on the friendliest of
terms, talking of the old times, the war, the
prospects of the colored people (the younger
ones were fast going to the bad, he thought),
while I stood looking out over the lake, a
pretty sheet of water, surrounded mostly by
cypress woods, but disfigured for the present
by the doings of lumbermen. What interested
me most (such is the fate of the devotee)
was a single barn swallow, the first
and only one that I saw on my Southern
trip.</p>

<p>On my way back to the city, after much
fatherly advice about the road on the part
of the negro, who seemed to feel that I ran
the greatest risk of getting lost, I made
two more additions to my Florida catalogue&mdash;the
wood duck and the yellow-billed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">« 223 »</a></span>
cuckoo, the latter unexpectedly early (April
11), since Mr. Chapman had recorded it as
arriving at Gainesville at a date sixteen days
later than this.</p>

<p>I did not repeat my visit to Lake Bradford;
but, not to give up the ivory-bill too
easily,&mdash;and because I must walk somewhere,&mdash;I
went again as far as the palmetto
scrub. This time, though I still missed the
woodpecker, I was fortunate enough to come
upon a turkey. In the thickest part of the
wood, as I turned a corner, there she stood
before me in the middle of the road. She
ran along the horse-track for perhaps a rod,
and then disappeared among the palmetto
leaves.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, two or three days before,
while returning from St. Mark&rsquo;s, whither I
had gone for a day on the river, I had
noticed from the car window a swamp, or
baygall, which looked so promising that I
went the very next morning to see what it
would yield. I had taken it for a cypress
swamp, but it proved to be composed mainly
of oaks; very tall but rather slender trees,
heavily draped with hanging moss and
standing in black water. Among them were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">« 224 »</a></span>
the swollen stumps, three or four feet high,
of larger trees which had been felled. I
pushed in through the surrounding shrubbery
and bay-trees, and waited for some
time, leaning against one of the larger
trunks and listening to the noises, of which
the air of the swamp was full. Great-crested
flycatchers, two Acadian flycatchers,
a multitude of blue yellow-backed warblers,
and what I supposed to be some loud-voiced
frogs were especially conspicuous in the concert;
but a Carolina wren, a cardinal, a red-eyed
vireo, and a blue-gray gnatcatcher, the
last with the merest thread of a voice, contributed
their share to the medley, and once
a chickadee struck up his sweet and gentle
strain in the very depths of the swamp&mdash;like
an angel singing in hell.</p>

<p>My walk on the railway, that wonderful
St. Mark&rsquo;s branch (I could never have imagined
the possibility of running trains over
so crazy a track), took me through the
choicest of bird country. The bushes were
alive, and the air rang with music. In the
midst of the chorus I suddenly caught somewhere
before me what I had no doubt was
the song of a purple finch, a bird that I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">« 225 »</a></span>
not yet seen in Florida. I quickened my
steps, and to my delight the singer proved
to be a blue grosbeak. I had caught a
glimpse of one two days before, as I have
described in another chapter, but with no
opportunity for a final identification. Here,
as it soon turned out, there were at least
four birds, all males, and all singing; chasing
each other about after the most persistent
fashion, in a piece of close shrubbery
with tall trees interspersed, and acting&mdash;the
four of them&mdash;just as two birds
are often seen to do when contending for
the possession of a building site. At a first
hearing the song seems not so long sustained
as the purple finch&rsquo;s commonly is, but exceedingly
like it in voice and manner, though
not equal to it, I should be inclined to say,
in either respect. The birds made frequent
use of a monosyllabic call, corresponding
to the calls of the purple finch and the
rose-breasted grosbeak, but readily distinguishable
from both. I was greatly pleased
to see them, and thought them extremely
handsome, with their dark blue plumage set
off by wing patches of rich chestnut.</p>

<p>A little farther, and I was saluted by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">« 226 »</a></span>
saucy cry of my first Florida chat. The
fellow had chosen just such a tangled
thicket as he favors in Massachusetts, and
whistled and kept out of sight after the
most approved manner of his kind. On the
other side of the track a white-eyed vireo
was asserting himself, as he had been doing
since the day I reached St. Augustine; but
though he seems a pretty clever substitute
for the chat in the chat&rsquo;s absence, his light
is quickly put out when the clown himself
steps into the ring. Ground doves cooed,
cardinals whistled, and mocking-birds sang
and mocked by turns. Orchard orioles, no
unworthy companions of mocking-birds and
cardinals, sang here and there from a low
treetop, especially in the vicinity of houses.
To judge from what I saw, they are among
the most characteristic of Tallahassee birds,&mdash;as
numerous as Baltimore orioles are in
Massachusetts towns, and frequenting much
the same kind of places. In one day&rsquo;s walk
I counted twenty-five. Elegantly dressed as
they are,&mdash;and elegance is better than
brilliancy, perhaps, even in a bird,&mdash;they
seem to be thoroughly democratic. It was
a pleasure to see them so fond of cabin dooryards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">« 227 »</a></span></p>

<p>Of the other birds along the St. Mark&rsquo;s
railway, let it be enough to mention white-throated
and white-crowned sparrows, red-eyed
chewinks (the white-eye was not found
in the Tallahassee region), a red-bellied
woodpecker, two red-shouldered hawks,
shrikes, kingbirds, yellow-throated warblers,
Maryland yellow-throats, pine warblers,
palm warblers,&mdash;which in spite of their
name seek their summer homes north of
the United States,&mdash;myrtle warblers, now
grown scarce, house wrens, summer tanagers,
and quails. The last-named birds,
by the way, I had expected to find known
as &ldquo;partridges&rdquo; at the South, but as a
matter of fact I heard that name applied
to them only once. On the St. Augustine
road, before breakfast, I met an old negro
setting out for his day&rsquo;s work behind a
pair of oxen. &ldquo;Taking some good exercise?&rdquo;
he asked, by way of a neighborly
greeting; and, not to be less neighborly
than he, I responded with some remark
about a big shot-gun which occupied a conspicuous
place in his cart. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said,
"game is plenty out where we are going,
about eight miles, and I take the gun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">« 228 »</a></span>
along." &ldquo;What kind of game?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,
sir, we may sometimes find a partridge.&rdquo; I
smiled at the anti-climax, but was glad to
hear Bob White honored for once with his
Southern title.</p>

<p>A good many of my jaunts took me past
the gallinule swamp before mentioned, and
almost always I stopped and went near. It
was worth while to hear the poultry cries of
the gallinules if nothing more; and often
several of the birds would be seen swimming
about among the big white lilies and the
green tussocks. Once I discovered one of
them sitting upright on a stake,&mdash;a precarious
seat, off which he soon tumbled
awkwardly into the water. At another
time, on the same stake, sat some dark,
strange-looking object. The opera-glass
showed it at once to be a large bird sitting
with its back toward me, and holding
its wings uplifted in the familiar heraldic,
<i>e-pluribus-unum</i> attitude of our American
spread-eagle; but even then it was some
seconds before I recognized it as an anhinga,&mdash;water-turkey,&mdash;though
it was a male
in full nuptial garb. I drew nearer and
nearer, and meanwhile it turned squarely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">« 229 »</a></span>
about,&mdash;a slow and ticklish operation,&mdash;so
that its back was presented to the sun;
as if it had dried one side of its wings and
tail,&mdash;for the latter, too, was fully spread,&mdash;and
now would dry the other. There for
some time it sat preening its feathers, with
monstrous twistings and untwistings of its
snaky neck. If the chat is a clown, the water-turkey
would make its fortune as a contortionist.
Finally it rose, circled about till
it got well aloft, and then, setting its wings,
sailed away southward and vanished, leaving
me in a state of wonder as to where it
had come from, and whether it was often to
be seen in such a place&mdash;perfectly open,
close beside the highway, and not far from
houses. I did not expect ever to see another,
but the next morning, on my way up
the railroad to pay a second visit to the
ivory-bill&rsquo;s swamp, I looked up by chance,&mdash;a
brown thrush was singing on the telegraph
wire,&mdash;and saw two anhingas soaring
overhead, their silvery wings glistening in
the sun as they wheeled. I kept my glass
on them till the distance swallowed them up.</p>

<p>Of one long forenoon&rsquo;s ramble I retain
particular remembrance, not on account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">« 230 »</a></span>
any birds, but for a half hour of pleasant
human intercourse. I went out of the city
by an untried road, hoping to find some
trace of migrating birds, especially of certain
warblers, the prospect of whose acquaintance
was one of the lesser considerations
which had brought me so far from
home. No such trace appeared, however,
nor, in my fortnight&rsquo;s stay in Tallahassee, in
almost the height of the migratory season,
did I, so far as I could tell, see a single
passenger bird of any sort. Some species
arrived from the South&mdash;cuckoos and orioles,
for example; others, no doubt, took
their departure for the North; but to the
best of my knowledge not one passed
through. It was a strange contrast to what
is witnessed everywhere in New England.
By some other route swarms of birds must
at that moment have been entering the
United States from Mexico and beyond;
but unless my observation was at fault,&mdash;and
I am assured that sharper eyes than
mine have had a similar experience,&mdash;their
line of march did not bring them into the
Florida hill-country. My morning&rsquo;s road
not only showed me no birds, but led me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">« 231 »</a></span>
nowhere, and, growing discouraged, I turned
back till I came to a lane leading off to the
left at right angles. This I followed so far
that it seemed wise, if possible, to make my
way back to the city without retracing my
steps. Not to spend my strength for naught,
however (the noonday sun having always to
be treated with respect), I made for a solitary
house in the distance. Another lane
ran past it. That, perhaps, would answer
my purpose. I entered the yard, all ablaze
with roses, and in response to my knock a
gentleman appeared upon the doorstep.
Yes, he said, the lane would carry me
straight to the Meridian road (so I think he
called it), and thence into the city. &ldquo;Past
Dr. H.'s?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And then I
knew where I was.</p>

<p>First, however, I must let my new acquaintance
show me his garden. His name
was G., he said. Most likely I had heard
of him, for the legislature was just then having
a good deal to say about his sheep, in
connection with some proposed dog-law.
Did I like roses? As he talked he cut one
after another, naming each as he put it into
my hand. Then I must look at his Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">« 232 »</a></span>
persimmon trees, and many other things.
Here was a pretty shrub. Perhaps I could
tell what it was by crushing and smelling a
leaf? No; it was something familiar; I
sniffed, and looked foolish, and after all he
had to tell me its name&mdash;camphor. So we
went the rounds of the garden,&mdash;frightening
a mocking-bird off her nest in an orange-tree,&mdash;till
my hands were full. It is too
bad I have forgotten how many pecan-trees
he had planted, and how many sheep he
kept. A well-regulated memory would have
held fast to such figures: mine is certain
only that there were four eggs in the mocking-bird&rsquo;s
nest. Mr. G. was a man of enterprise,
at any rate; a match for any Yankee,
although he had come to Florida not
from Yankeeland, but from northern Georgia.
I hope all his crops are still thriving,
especially his white roses and his Marshal
Niels.</p>

<p>In the lane, after skirting some pleasant
woods, which I meant to visit again, but
found no opportunity, I was suddenly assaulted
by a pair of brown thrashers, half
beside themselves after their manner because
of my approach to their nest. How close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">« 233 »</a></span>
my approach was I cannot say; but it must
be confessed that I played upon their fears
to the utmost of my ability, wishing to see
as many of their neighbors as the disturbance
would bring together. Several other
thrashers, a catbird, and two house wrens
appeared (all these, since &ldquo;blood is thicker
than water,&rdquo; may have felt some special
cousinly solicitude, for aught I know), with
a ruby-crowned kinglet and a field sparrow.</p>

<p>In the valley, near a little pond, as I came
out into the Meridian road, a solitary vireo
was singing, in the very spot where one had
been heard six days before. Was it the
same bird? I asked myself. And was it
settled for the summer? Such an explanation
seemed the more likely because I had
found no solitary vireo anywhere else about
the city though the species had been common
earlier in the season in eastern and
southern Florida, where I had seen my last
one&mdash;at New Smyrna&mdash;March 26.</p>

<p>At this same dip in the Meridian road,
on a previous visit, I had experienced one of
the pleasantest of my Tallahassee sensations.
The morning was one of those when every
bird is in tune. By the roadside I had just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">« 234 »</a></span>
passed Carolina wrens, house wrens, a chipper,
a field sparrow, two thrashers, an abundance
of chewinks, two orchard orioles,
several tanagers, a flock of quail, and mocking-birds
and cardinals uncounted. In a
pine-wood near by, a wood pewee, a pine
warbler, a yellow-throated warbler, and a
pine-wood sparrow were singing&mdash;a most
peculiarly select and modest chorus. Just
at the lowest point in the valley I stopped
to listen to a song which I did not recognize,
but which, by and by, I settled upon as
probably the work of a freakish prairie warbler.
At that moment, as if to confirm my
conjecture,&mdash;which in the retrospect becomes
almost ridiculous,&mdash;a prairie warbler
hopped into sight on an outer twig of the
water-oak out of which the music had proceeded.
Still something said, &ldquo;Are you
sure?&rdquo; and I stepped inside the fence.
There on the ground were two or three
white-crowned sparrows, and in an instant
the truth of the case flashed upon me. I
remembered the saying of a friend, that the
song of the white-crown had reminded him
of the vesper sparrow and the black-throated
green warbler. That was my bird; and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">« 235 »</a></span>
listened again, though I could no longer be
said to feel in doubt. A long time I waited.
Again and again the birds sang, and at last
I discovered one of them perched at the top
of the oak, tossing back his head and warbling&mdash;a
white-crowned sparrow: the one
regular Massachusetts migrant which I had
often seen, but had never heard utter a
sound.</p>

<p>The strain opens with smooth, sweet notes
almost exactly like the introductory syllables
of the vesper sparrow. Then the tone
changes, and the remainder of the song is in
something like the pleasingly hoarse voice of
a prairie warbler, or a black-throated green.
It is soft and very pretty; not so perfect a
piece of art as the vesper sparrow&rsquo;s tune,&mdash;few
bird-songs are,&mdash;but taking for its very
oddity, and at the same time tender and
sweet. More than one writer has described
it as resembling the song of the white-throat.
Even Minot, who in general was the most
painstaking and accurate of observers, as he
is one of the most interesting of our systematic
writers, says that the two songs are
&ldquo;almost exactly&rdquo; alike. There could be no
better example of the fallibility which attaches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">« 236 »</a></span>
and in the nature of the case must
attach, to all writing upon such subjects.
The two songs have about as much in common
as those of the hermit thrush and
the brown thrasher, or those of the song
sparrow and the chipper. In other words,
they have nothing in common. Probably
in Minot&rsquo;s case, as in so many others
of a similar nature, the simple explanation
is that when he thought he was listening
to one bird he was really listening to
another.</p>

<p>The Tallahassee road to which I had oftenest
resorted, to which, now, from far Massachusetts,
I oftenest look back, the St. Augustine
road, so called, I have spoken of
elsewhere. Thither, after packing my trunk
on the morning of the 18th, I betook myself
for a farewell stroll. My holiday was
done. For the last time, perhaps, I listened
to the mocking-bird and the cardinal, as by
and by, when the grand holiday is over, I
shall listen to my last wood thrush and my
last bluebird. But what then? Florida
fields are still bright, and neither mocking-bird
nor cardinal knows aught of my absence.
And so it <i>will</i> be.</p>

<p>None the less, it is good to have lived
our day and taken our peep at the mighty
show. Ten thousand things we may have
fretted ourselves about, uselessly or worse.
But to have lived in the sun, to have loved
natural beauty, to have felt the majesty of
trees, to have enjoyed the sweetness of
flowers and the music of birds,&mdash;so much,
at least, is not vanity nor vexation of spirit.</p>

Produced by Tom Cosmas compiled from images made available
by The Internet Archive.


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
